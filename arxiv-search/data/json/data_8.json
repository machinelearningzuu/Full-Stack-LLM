One of the leading AI models in this domain is OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4[ 1],\nwhich has recently been enhanced with a multimodal variant, GPT-4V[ 2], incorporating image input capabilities. This\nmodel extension draws from the formidable linguistic foundation of GPT-4 and has garnered significant attention due to\nits potential in processing and interpreting medical imagery.\nPrior evaluations, such as those conducted by Chaoyi Wu et al, have provided a detailed examination of GPT-4V\u2019s\nmedical performance, probing the limits of its image processing abilities[ 3], also the performance of GPT-4V in medical\nexamination has been tested[ 4,5,6] and reveals the potential of the usage of GPT-4V in the medical area. In the realm\nof MLLMs, performance is contingent on both image comprehension and textual understanding capabilities. Merely\ninputting an image along with basic, unrefined prompts does not fully utilize the model\u2019s language understanding\npotential and only partially engages its image interpretation capabilities. To delineate the boundaries of GPT-4V\u2019sarXiv:2312.04344v2  [cs.CL]  12 Dec 2023 abilities, research focused on prompt optimization is crucial. Building upon previous studies, this work concentrates on\nexploring the optimal combination of prompts to enable GPT-4V to operate at its peak efficiency, thereby offering novel\ninsights for subsequent medical research utilizing GPT-4V .\nIn our investigation, we selected diverse modalities of data and experimented with various combinations of textual\nand visual prompts. Ultimately, we synthesized ten tips that significantly enhance GPT-4V\u2019s performance in medical\napplications. Given that the focus of this study is on prompt engineering rather than an exhaustive test of medical\ncapabilities, we did not examine an extensive array of cases. Instead, this paper will showcase results from a selected\nset of tests, emphasizing the impact of strategic prompt design on enhancing the model\u2019s effectiveness in medical image\nanalysis and interpretation.\n2 Methods\n2.1 Overview\nIn this study, we utilize an image and text prompt as the input, followed by a manual assessment of the output\u2019s quality.\nOur methodology involves presenting the same image with a variety of textual prompts. Each prompt\u2019s output is then\nsubject to a thorough human evaluation. When a particular textual prompt yields exceptionally positive results, it\nundergoes more in-depth testing and further evaluation in our test sets. If this prompt strategy consistently demonstrates\nsuperior performance across all tests, it is then incorporated into our list of effective prompt tips.\nTo optimize the testing process and ensure rigorous and systematic evaluation, we have established the following 8\nrules during the test part:\n\u2022Rule 1 - The latest data policy: Considering that GPT-4\u2019s training data does not extend beyond the year 2021,\nour selected dataset predominantly consists of data from 2022 onwards or from our own collected data. A\nsmaller portion of the dataset may originate from 2021 and prior, but we intentionally do not employ this data\nfor diagnostic tasks to prevent testing on the training set. Regarding data that may have been trained on by\nGPT-4 and its variants, we use it solely for tasks such as pairing, semantic recognition, and others that have no\ndirect correlation with GPT-4\u2019s pre-training activities.\n\u2022Rule 2 - Challenging High-Difficulty Projects for Superiority Proofs: In order to demonstrate the superiority\nof our prompt-crafting techniques, we actively undertake challenging projects. Some of these tasks may\nlack immediate clinical utility; however, they serve as significant tests to evaluate the model\u2019s capabilities in\nhandling medical images.\n\u2022Rule 3 - Ablation Studies to Avoid Answer Leakage: For certain scenarios, we employ ablation studies to\neliminate the possibility of answer leakage. Previous research on GPT-4V has often overlooked the restriction\nof prompt content, leading to scenarios where correct answers could be deduced from the text alone[ 5], making\nit unclear whether the results were derived from image recognition capabilities or textual understanding. In\nsuch cases, ablation studies are essential to distinguish between these two possibilities, thereby ensuring a\nmore accurate assessment of the model\u2019s performance.\n\u2022Rule 4 - Focus on Conclusion Accuracy Over Process Correctness: During our experiments, we do not\ndelve into the correctness of each output detail. All tests generate extensive content, sometimes including\ncorrect conclusions based on partially incorrect reasoning, or vice versa. Our primary concern is the accuracy\nof the conclusions drawn, rather than the correctness of each step in the reasoning process.\n\u2022Rule 5 - Ignoring Disclaimers in Medical Contexts: Given that GPT-4V is not a modality model specifically\ntrained for medical purposes, developers typically include disclaimers in medical-related content to prevent its\nuse in diagnostic contexts. Since these disclaimers often occupy significant space and are not central to our\nresearch focus, we choose to disregard them in our analysis. This allows us to concentrate on the content\u2019s\nrelevance and accuracy without the distraction of repetitive legal cautioning.\n\u2022Rule 6 - Trialing Outputs Thrice for Stability Analysis: In previous studies, the stability of GPT-4V\u2019s\nresponses, particularly in natural image contexts, was not scrutinized. However, in medical imagery, we\nobserved that GPT-4V sometimes produces different answers for the same prompt[ 7]. Therefore, analyzing\nthe stability of these responses is a critical aspect of our study. For lengthy outputs like video process analyses,\nwe report the weakest result from multiple trials to highlight areas needing improvement.\n\u2022Rule 7 - Single-Round Dialogue Tests Unless Otherwise Specified: Unless explicitly stated as multi-round\ndialogue tests, all experiments are conducted as single-round dialogues. After each dialogue, the session is\nimmediately terminated and a new session is started for the subsequent test. This approach ensures that each test is evaluated independently, allowing for a more accurate assessment of the model\u2019s performance in isolated\ninteractions.\n\u2022Rule 8 - Version Specification of GPT-4V: The version of GPT4-V used in our research spans from September\n27 to October 18, 2023. It is important to note that subsequent updates to the model post this period may\nimpact the effectiveness of certain prompt tips, potentially rendering some obsolete. This time frame is critical\nfor contextualizing our findings and understanding the specific capabilities of the model version under study.\nIn the manual evaluation part, we compared the outputs of GPT-4V against a set of reference answers. This process\ninvolved a scoring system wherein a match with the reference answer earned one point. Responses that were not\nincorrect but also not completely aligned with the reference answer neither gained nor lost points. Incorrect answers\nresulted in a deduction of one point. Through this scoring mechanism, we calculated the scores for each distinct\nprompt strategy employed during the study. The 10 prompt tips with the highest scores were then extracted. These\ntop-scoring prompt tips form the crux of our study\u2019s conclusions, offering valuable insights into the most effective ways\nof interacting with the GPT-4V model. This approach not only underscores the model\u2019s capabilities but also highlights\nthe nuances of optimizing AI interactions in complex tasks.\n2.2 Testing procedure\nIn the specific context of prompt testing, the experimental process of our study typically divides into two or three\ndistinct parts:\n\u2022Control Group: Under the guidelines mentioned in Section 2.1, within this group, we generally employ\nthe simplest and most direct prompts, or sometimes only input the image without any textual prompt. Upon\nobtaining the corresponding outputs, these are then compared with the reference answers for scoring.\n\u2022Experiment Group: Also following the rules outlined in Section 2.1, this group uses the same images as the\ncontrol group for input. However, the textual prompts are optimized for this set. The outputs generated from\nthese optimized prompts are then compared with the reference answers and scored accordingly.\n\u2022Ablation Study (if necessary): In accordance with the rules specified in Section 2.1, this part of the experiment\ninvolves inputting only textual prompts without any images. The outputs are then compared with the reference\nanswers for evaluation and scoring.\nA typical demonstration template is shown in Figure2.2. This structured approach enables a comprehensive assessment\nof the model\u2019s performance under different conditions, allowing for a clear understanding of the impact of various\nprompt strategies, Among all the trials, we will list out 10 tips for effective prompts.\nFigure 1: A typical example of demonstration, illustrating the basic information of a case along with the results from\nboth control and experimental groups 2.3 Testing dataset\nIn our study, the endoscopy group in the test set utilized data from the Kvasir_SEG [8]and M2caiseg datasets[ 9],\nalongside data from the hysteroscopy procedures we collected. For CT imaging, the AutoPET [10],TotalSegmentator [11],\nAbdomenCT-1K [12] datasets were used, supplemented with data from relevant literature. MRI data incorporated the\nBraTS 2021 [13],ATLAS V2.0 andAMOS 2021 [14] datasets. It is crucial to acknowledge that this dataset compilation is\nnot comprehensive and does not represent all medical scenarios. Nonetheless, it provides an adequate basis for testing\nour prompt tips. Future endeavors will aim to expand this dataset to further enrich the study.\n3 Prompt Tips\nUtilizing the aforementioned testing methodology and adhering to the established rules, we have successfully identified\nten valuable prompt tips:\n1.Concise language is more effective than complex descriptions, emphasizing succinct, task-relevant details in\nimage analysis.\n2. Providing the tasks can better help analyze the images\n3.Implementing step-by-step guidance in multi-round dialogue allows GPT-4V to handle complex tasks more\nefficiently by breaking them down into simpler operations.\n4. Don\u2019t expose your target at the very beginning when you start the multi-round dialog\n5. Describing appearances or characteristics will greatly enhance the performance.\n6. Appearance descriptors should be non-conflicting with any image annotations to avoid misinterpretations.\n7.Clarifying the contextual relationships between sequential images enhances GPT-4V\u2019s analytical accuracy and\ndetail recognition.\n8.Splicing multiple images into one and providing a sequence order enhances task processing effectiveness\ncompared to multiple simultaneous inputs.\n9.Providing comparative analysis opportunities, especially with temporal patient data, deepens lesion or condition\nassessments.\n10. Directing GPT-4V\u2019s focus to the interested areas will facilitate more targeted and relevant output.\n4 Discussion\n4.1 Tip 1: Concise language is more effective than complex descriptions, emphasizing succinct, task-relevant\ndetails in image analysis.\n4.1.1 Demonstration Info\nIn this demonstration, we conducted a comparative analysis of prompt outcomes using concise language versus\ncomplex descriptions within endoscopic, CT, and MRI imaging contexts, all under the condition of providing equivalent\ninformation. The study meticulously compared the effectiveness of simplified and elaborate prompt styles on GPT-4V\u2019s\nperformance. The final results clearly indicated that, when the same amount of information is provided, prompts\narticulated in a concise manner significantly enhance GPT-4V\u2019s functional capabilities. This finding underscores the\nimportance of prompt language efficiency in optimizing the performance of AI models in medical imaging scenarios,\nsuggesting that brevity and clarity in prompts can lead to more effective AI analysis and interpretation within various\nmedical imaging modalities.\n4.1.2 Analysis\nBased on the tests conducted, we observed that within endoscopic scenarios, simplified descriptions yielded better\noutcomes compared to complex descriptions. In contrast, within CT and MRI contexts, the performance of simplified\ndescriptions was comparable to that of complex descriptions, both showing significant improvements over control\ngroups with no or weak descriptions.\nIn this regard, we posit that the superior performance of simplified descriptions can be attributed to their provision\nof only the most critical information. Complex descriptions, conversely, offer an abundance of auxiliary information.\nDuring the generation of textual content, the weight of these auxiliary descriptive elements is also accounted for, which consequently diminishes the relative importance of core information. This can lead to slight deviations in results,\npotentially resulting in inaccuracies. Therefore, when inputting prompts into GPT-4V , it is advisable to include only the\nmost relevant core information pertaining to the query at hand, minimizing the incorporation of extensive, indirectly\nrelated descriptive language.\n4.2 Tip 2: Providing the tasks can better help analyze the images\n4.2.1 Demonstration Info\nIn this demonstration, we illustrate how the task of providing medical images enhances the model\u2019s ability to analyze\ninput medical images. We focus particularly on the identification of surgical instruments in single endoscopic images\nand the analysis of endoscopic sequences. An ablation study was incorporated into this demonstration to ensure that the\ntextual prompts provided did not leak the answers. This approach underscores the effectiveness of combining visual\nand textual inputs in improving the model\u2019s performance in medical image analysis, while also ensuring the integrity of\nthe results through rigorous testing methods.\n4.2.2 Analysis\nIn this test, we found that specifying the type of task significantly enhances the recognition capabilities of GPT-4V .\nWe believe that medical images, particularly endoscopic images, are challenging to differentiate based on a single\nimage due to the limitations of the endoscope\u2019s field of view (FOV) and the similarity of most endoscopic scenes. This\nmakes it difficult to identify the specific task of the endoscope, thereby complicating the analysis of the problem. After\nspecifying the particular task of the endoscope, the probability distribution of the output becomes more focused on the\nanswer, thereby increasing the accuracy of the response.\nTo further validate the effectiveness of our prompt strategy, we conducted an ablation study. In the ablation study, we\ndid not input images and merely inputted prompts telling GPT-4V to pretend there was an image, then asked GPT-4V\nthe same questions. If GPT-4V could still provide the correct answers under these circumstances, it would indicate that\nwe had leaked answer-related information in our prompts. If it could not respond correctly, it would suggest that we did\nnot disclose any answer-related information in our prompts.\nWe discovered that with pure text input, GPT-4V could not correctly answer our questions or provide analysis, indicating\nthat our prompts did not leak additional information. This means that the correct answers were due to our prompt\nguiding the image analysis rather than the prompt leaking key answer-related information.\nIn contrast, we presented Case 4, a prompt we believe leaked some answer-related information. Compared to Case 3,\nwe included a key piece of information, \"ring-shape,\" which could lead GPT-4V to produce the correct answer without\nan image.\nIn summary, we believe that the conclusion that GPT-4V\u2019s performance can be further enhanced by providing the task\nis solid and valid.\n4.3 Tip 3: Implementing step-by-step guidance in multi-round dialogue allows GPT-4v to handle complex tasks\nmore efficiently by breaking them down into simpler operations.\n4.3.1 Demonstration Info\nIn this demonstration, we showcased how, through step-by-step prompt tips, efficient matching of medical images with\ntheir corresponding masks can be achieved. It is important to emphasize that while this task may not hold substantial\nclinical significance, we selected it for demonstration due to its high level of difficulty. This task demands the utmost\nutilization of the multimodal model\u2019s image understanding capabilities, thereby exemplifying the value of prompt tips.\nWe also presented comparisons across three different modalities: endoscopy, CT, and MRI. These comparisons were\nbased on scenarios where prompt tips were not used, where step-by-step guidance was provided in a single-round\ndialogue, and where step-by-step guidance was facilitated through multi-round dialogues. Our findings indicate that\nguiding GPT through multi-round dialogues with step-by-step instructions yielded the most effective results. This\nhighlights the potential of structured, iterative interactions in harnessing the full capabilities of advanced AI models in\ncomplex image analysis tasks.\n4.3.2 Analysis\nIn our study, the tests conducted on endoscopic imagery revealed certain limitations in GPT-4V\u2019s processing capabilities.\nSpecifically, when tasked with identifying which mask correlates with a polyp in a colon image, GPT-4V consistently errs towards selecting the second mask. This error appears to stem from its misinterpretation of the vertical alignment\nof the real colonoscopy images and their corresponding masks, leading to a mistaken assumption of correlation where\nnone exists.\nNevertheless, we observed that a gradual, step-by-step guidance approach significantly enhances GPT-4V\u2019s performance\nin handling complex tasks. However, this enhancement is not as pronounced when all step-by-step instructions are\nconsolidated into a single-round dialogue. We believe this finding aligns with the conclusion drawn in Tip 1, which\nemphasizes that prompts should not be excessively lengthy or complex. In the process of guiding GPT-4V , the inclusion\nof an abundance of descriptive and medically irrelevant terminology adversely affected its performance, likely due to\nthe undue weight these words carried in the model\u2019s processing.\nConversely, when we divided the step-by-step guidance across multiple rounds of dialogue, we noticed a marked\nimprovement in GPT-4V\u2019s performance. This approach enabled it to accomplish challenging tasks, like accurate\nmask matching, with a high degree of precision\u2014a feat not yet achievable by other large multimodal models. Such a\nprompting strategy effectively leverages GPT-4V\u2019s powerful capabilities.\nSimilarly, we observed a comparable effect in both the CT and MRI groups. Without any specifically designed prompts,\nGPT-4V failed to correctly identify the tasks at hand. However, with the incorporation of step-by-step guidance, there\nwas a significant enhancement in performance, with multi-round dialogues demonstrating even more pronounced\nimprovements. This evidence suggests that a structured, interactive approach is crucial for maximizing the potential of\nadvanced multimodal AI models in complex medical imaging tasks.\n4.4 Tip 4: Don\u2019t expose your target at the very beginning when you start multi-round dialog\n4.4.1 Demonstration Info\nIn the previous demonstration, we showcased how step-by-step guidance within a multi-turn dialogue can effectively\naccomplish challenging tasks. In this demonstration, we aim to present a strategy that may potentially weaken the\neffectiveness of prompts: prematurely revealing the objective. We will use the same three cases and almost identical\nprompts as in the previous demonstration. The key difference, however, lies in our approach: we will disclose our\nobjective \u2013 matching masks with medical images to GPT-4V right from the start.\nThis setup allows us to critically evaluate the impact of early goal exposure on the performance of GPT-4V in completing\nthe task. By comparing the outcomes of this approach with those from the previous demonstration, where the objective\nwas gradually introduced, we aim to discern the influence of prompt structure and information sequencing on the\nmodel\u2019s efficiency and accuracy in task execution. This investigation is pivotal in understanding the nuances of effective\nprompt design, particularly in complex problem-solving scenarios involving AI models.\n4.4.2 Analysis\nIn this demonstration, a notable difference from the previous one was observed when the objective was prematurely\nrevealed. Despite employing our previously high-accuracy prompt strategies, the accuracy remained markedly low,\ncomparable to the performance achieved with unrefined prompts.\nOur observation led to the discovery that this decrease in performance is attributable to the \"short-term memory\" of\nGPT-4V . To elaborate, if the objective is revealed too early, GPT-4V tends to immediately generate an answer based\non the exposed information. The quality of this answer is similar to that produced by unrefined prompts, which is to\nsay, it is of lower quality. Further, if prompts are inputted after receiving this initial answer, in an attempt to guide\nGPT-4V , the subsequent outputs tend to be erroneous, aligning with the previously derived incorrect answer. The strong\nshort-term memory of GPT-4V means that if the initial output is not manually identified as incorrect, it carries this\nerroneous prior into subsequent responses, thus affecting the quality of the answers. Therefore, when using GPT-4V\nwith the intention of achieving a specific outcome through multi-turn dialogue, it is advisable not to disclose the task\nobjective at the onset.\n4.5 Tip 5: Describing appearances or characteristics will greatly enhance the performance.\n4.5.1 Demonstration Info\nIn this demonstration, we illustrated that providing descriptions of appearance or characteristics significantly enhances\nthe model\u2019s performance. For the descriptions of appearance or characteristics, we adopted definitions from Wikipedia\nin this showcase. Given that this prompt tip involves detailed descriptions of appearance and characteristics, it is most\neffectively applied in scenarios where there is a need for batch processing of data that is familiar to the user. 4.5.2 Analysis\nIn this study, we discovered that providing specific descriptions of shapes and appearances significantly enhances\nGPT-4V\u2019s ability to recognize certain structures. In the control group, where no descriptions were provided, the\nperformance was suboptimal. Specifically, within the endoscopy group, organs like the liver, fat, and intestines were\ndifficult to identify without prompts, with only the gallbladder being relatively easier to recognize. In CT and MRI\nimaging, GPT-4V was able to identify easily recognizable organs like the liver without additional prompts, whereas\nidentifying the gallbladder and pancreas proved to be more challenging.\nSubsequently, we utilized organ-specific prompts based on appearance descriptions from Wikipedia and Mayo Clinic,\namong others. It is crucial to note that GPT-4V may output descriptions of the images in the order of the input prompts.\nIf the order of descriptions inputted matches the order of annotations in the image, this might result in correct outputs.\nHowever, these outputs could be derived from the order of the input descriptions rather than an understanding of the\nimage. To mitigate this, we intentionally scrambled the order of our descriptions to prevent answer leakage due to input\nsequencing. We observed a substantial increase in recognition accuracy upon providing appearance descriptions. In\nthe endoscopy group, apart from the intestines which remained challenging, other structures were identified with high\naccuracy. In both the CT and MRI groups, complete and accurate identification was achieved, including small structures\nlike the gallbladder in MRI images.\nFurthermore, we also observed that when dealing with markers of different colors, it is advisable to avoid using\ncolor-related descriptions. Such descriptions can lead to confusion in GPT-4V\u2019s processing. We will delve into this\nphenomenon in greater detail in the following chapter, examining the implications of color descriptions on the model\u2019s\ninterpretive accuracy and how they might inadvertently mislead the AI\u2019s analysis.\n4.6 Tip 6: Appearance descriptors should be non-conflicting with any image annotations to avoid\nmisinterpretations.\n4.6.1 Demonstration Info\nIn the previous chapter, we discussed the impact of appearance descriptions on the performance of GPT-4V , noting\na significant enhancement in its capabilities. Given that appearance descriptions often involve color, especially in\nendoscopic scenarios, it is pertinent to explore the outcomes when markers are also denoted by colors. In this round\nof demonstrations, we excluded data from CT and MRI modalities, as these primarily involve grayscale imaging and\nseldom incorporate colors beyond black and white. This focus allows us to specifically assess the influence of color\ndescriptions in contexts where color plays a critical role, providing insights into the nuances of prompt design for\ncolor-rich medical imaging scenarios\n4.6.2 Analysis\nIn this chapter, we discovered that using color descriptors in scenarios where markers are also color-coded can\nsignificantly impair performance. In this showcase, the results were even worse than those in the control group (Section\n4.5.1). Notably, all instances of yellow dots were incorrectly identified as fat. This misidentification likely stems from\nGPT-4V interpreting the yellow dots as part of the scene rather than as markers. When we described fat as \"generally\npale yellow,\" GPT-4V mistakenly classified the yellow dots as fat. This observation underscores the importance of\ncareful consideration in using color descriptors, particularly in contexts where color plays a dual role in both the scene\nand the markers.\n4.7 Tip 7: Clarifying the contextual relationships between sequential images enhances GPT-4v\u2019s analytical\naccuracy and detail recognition.\n4.7.1 Demonstration Info\nThis demonstration primarily focused on the processing of endoscopic sequences. We composed a single image by\ncombining four pictures from a hysteroscopy to assess GPT-4V\u2019s capability in handling endoscopic sequences. The test\nwas divided into two groups: one without inputting the image sequence numbers6.7.1 and another with the sequence\nnumbers included 6.7.1. Our findings indicate that image analysis is more effective when the sequence order of the\nimages is provided. This result highlights the importance of sequential context in enhancing the model\u2019s comprehension\nand accuracy in processing related images in a series. 4.7.2 Analysis\nOur findings in this chapter reveal that providing the sequential order of images significantly enhances their analysis.\nThis approach is beneficial for processing video files as well. The underlying effectiveness of this strategy appears to\nstem from how GPT-4V perceives each image. Without sequence information, GPT-4V tends to treat each image as a\ndiscrete entity, leading to independent analysis with limited contextual understanding.\nHowever, when the sequential order is specified, or when the interrelationship among the images is clarified, GPT-4V is\nmore inclined to view the images as interconnected elements of a larger narrative. Consequently, it synthesizes a more\ncomprehensive workflow, encompassing the entire sequence from the first to the last image. This methodology proves\nespecially useful in the analysis of surgical procedures in videos or image sequences, allowing for a more integrated\nand coherent interpretation of the visual data.\n4.8 Tip 8: Splicing multiple images into one and providing a sequence order enhances task processing\neffectiveness compared to multiple simultaneous inputs.\n4.8.1 Demonstration Info\nIn the previous demonstration, we presented the results of splicing multiple images into one(6.7.1 and 6.7.1). GPT-4V ,\nhowever, possesses a built-in upload feature that can be used for analyzing image sequences. In this demonstration,\nwe will compare the outcomes of using GPT-4V\u2019s native upload feature versus splicing multiple images together. It is\nimportant to note that, as of the September 27 to December 12, 2023 version, this upload system can handle a maximum\nof four images at a time. Additionally, images uploaded through this system are automatically displayed in varying sizes\non the webpage, although their actual upload dimensions remain unchanged, as shown in Figure 6.8.1. This comparison\naims to highlight the differences in results obtained through these two methods of image presentation and processing.\n4.8.2 Analysis\nIn our prior showcase, we created a composite image by splicing together multiple individual images. However, in\nthis subsequent test, we employed GPT4-v\u2019s inherent image uploading feature to upload four images simultaneously,\nwhich is the system\u2019s maximum capacity, to analyze a surgical procedure depicted across these images. The results of\nthis test indicate that the direct upload of multiple images through GPT4-v\u2019s system tends to be less effective in the\nanalysis compared to utilizing a single, spliced composite image. This reduced effectiveness might be due to the current\nversion of GPT4-v not being fully optimized for multi-image analysis. While GPT4-v shows remarkable proficiency in\nprocessing single images, it seems there is a need for additional development to enhance its capability to handle and\ninterpreting multiple images concurrently.\n4.9 Tip 9: Providing comparative analysis opportunities, especially with temporal patient data, deepens lesion\nor condition assessments.\n4.9.1 Demonstration Info\nIn this demonstration, we highlighted the significant enhancement in GPT-4V\u2019s performance facilitated by the provision\nof comparative information. This comparison could involve contrasting healthy and abnormal states, or it might\npertain to changes in pathological lesions. Such juxtapositions provide GPT-4V with a richer context, enabling a more\naccurate and nuanced understanding of the medical imagery. By presenting contrasting scenarios or changes over time,\nGPT-4V can better discern subtle differences, leading to improved diagnostic accuracy. This approach underscores\nthe importance of contextual information in medical image analysis, particularly in complex cases where changes are\nsubtle or involve gradual progression.\n4.9.2 Analysis\nIn this test, we observed that providing GPT-4v with comparative images from before and after significantly improved\nthe accuracy of diagnoses. This is intuitively reasonable since the nature of many conditions, such as the growth of\npulmonary nodules, can be challenging to assess from a single, final-stage image. However, when presented with a\nseries of images depicting the nodule over several years, GPT-4v is able to analyze the growth pattern of the nodule.\nConsequently, this enables a more accurate assessment of the patient\u2019s condition.\nAdditionally, in diagnosing lung nodules, we opted not to mark incorrect responses, focusing instead on correctly\nanswered parts. This decision was based on the complexity inherent in diagnosing diseases solely from the growth\npatterns of nodules. We acknowledge that all responses provided by the model possess a certain degree of validity under these circumstances. However, it was observed that when images showing comparative growth were presented,\nall responses accurately identified adenocarcinoma as the correct diagnosis in the first answer. This finding suggests\nthat providing contextual visual information significantly enhances the model\u2019s diagnostic accuracy, particularly in\ncomplex cases like lung nodule analysis.\n4.10 Tip 10: Directing GPT-4V\u2019s focus to the interested areas will facilitate more targeted and relevant output.\n4.10.1 Demonstration Info\nIn this demonstration, we examined the impact of providing spatial orientation information on GPT-4V\u2019s recognition\ncapabilities. We observed that when directing GPT-4V\u2019s focus to the interested areas, GPT-4V\u2019s responses were notably\nmore coherent and accurate. This finding suggests that spatial information significantly aids the AI in contextualizing\nand interpreting medical images. This prompt tip is particularly useful in cases where the approximate location of a\nlesion is known, but a detailed analysis and diagnosis are required using GPT-4V . By integrating location-based cues\ninto the prompts, GPT-4V can focus its analysis more effectively, leading to more precise diagnostic outcomes. This\napproach highlights the importance of spatial context in enhancing AI-assisted medical image diagnosis.\n4.10.2 Analysis\nIn the experiments conducted in this chapter, we found that providing specific spatial orientation significantly enhances\nthe accuracy of GPT-4V\u2019s responses. In the MRI experiments, without specified location guidance, GPT-4V tended to\ndiagnose images as normal, even when there were clear abnormalities present. Once directed to focus on the \"upper left\nquadrant,\" GPT-4V promptly identified the anomalies in that region.\nIn the PET scan tests, without a defined area of observation, GPT-4V erroneously identified regions with naturally\nhigh metabolic activity, such as the brain, heart, and bladder, as potential pathological sites, leading to an incorrect\ndiagnosis of possible metastatic cancer. However, when GPT-4V was instructed to concentrate on the thoracic region,\nit successfully differentiated between cardiac activity and lung cancer, providing a more accurate diagnosis. These\nfindings highlight the importance of directional cues in assisting GPT-4V to accurately interpret medical imaging,\nemphasizing the need for precise location information in AI-assisted diagnostic processes.\n5 Summary\nIn this work, we identified ten valuable prompt tips that significantly enhance GPT-4V\u2019s utility in medical contexts\nthrough extensive testing across various datasets. These prompts led to marked performance improvements in all tasks,\ndemonstrating the power of well-designed prompts in enhancing AI analysis in medical imaging. Future research will\nbroaden the case spectrum and employ these prompt techniques for bulk data processing using APIs. Additionally, we\nplan to explore the effectiveness of these prompts in non-medical, natural image settings. This exploration aims to\nunderstand the adaptability of these strategies across different image analysis scenarios. Our findings not only contribute\nto medical image analysis using AI models but also open new avenues for applying AI-driven strategies in a wider\nrange of imaging applications.\nReferences\n[1] OpenAI.

The \"GPT-4V\" section captures the responses elicited by the GPT-4V model. It is\nimportant to note that, due to predetermined safeguard measures, GPT-4V consistently asserts its non-expertise in\nspecialized domains such as radiology. For clarity and succinctness, we have omitted these routine disclaimers from our\npresentation of results. \"Reference answer\" represents the standard responses or interpretations, as informed by expert\nsources like Radiopaedia.\nFor a clearer interpretation of our findings, we implemented a color-coding strategy:\n\u2022Red: Red identifies errors in GPT-4V\u2019s outputs, with corresponding information in the standard responses\nindicating the reason for these classifications.\n\u2022Green: Green emphasizes accurate responses, with identical segments in the expert responses confirming their\nvalidity.\n\u2022Yellow Yellow is designated for portions that are ambiguous or unclear.\n6.1 Tip 1: Concise language is more effective than complex descriptions, emphasizing succinct, task-relevant\ndetails in image analysis.\n6.1.1 Case 1: Endoscopic image annotation recognition\nCASE 1\n\u2022Picture modal: Endoscopic picture\n\u2022Tasks: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy\n\u2022Reference Answer:\n\u2013 Yellow Dot: Liver.\n\u2013 Red Dot: Surgical grasper.\n\u2013 Blue Dot: Gallbladder.\n\u2013 Green Dot: Fats.\n\u2013 Purple Dot: Intestine. CASE 1\nControl Group\nPrompt: Tell me what instrument or tissue each color represents.\nGPT-4V Response:\n\u2022response 1\n\u2013Yellow Dot: This looks like it could be the liver tissue. The liver is a large organ that\nsits right above the gallbladder, and its edge can be seen during gallbladder surgeries.\n\u2013Red Dot: This instrument is a clipapplicatororaclipholder. It\u2019s used to apply clips\nto blood vessels or ducts to ensure there is no bleeding or leakage after they are cut.\n\u2013Blue Dot: This appears to be the gallbladder itself, a pear-shaped organ that stores bile.\nIt looks like it\u2019s being held or elevated to expose its connection to other structures.\n\u2013Green Dot: This structure seems to be the cysticduct, which connects the gallbladder\nto the common bile duct. It\u2019s a key structure that surgeons need to identify and clip or\nligate during the procedure.\n\u2013Purple Dot: The structure at the location of the purple dot is not entirely clear from\nthe perspective of the image, but it might be a part of the omen tumoranother adipose\ntissue. The omentum is a fatty apron-like structure that hangs down from the stomach\nand covers some of the organs in the abdomen.\n\u2022response 2\n\u2013 Yellow Dot: This appears to be near the liver surface or surround ingfatty tissue.\n\u2013Red Dot: It\u2019s pointing towards a surgical instrument, likely a form of clamp or\ngrasper used duringtheprocedure.\n\u2013Blue Dot: This is located on what appears to be the gallbladder or a surround ingduct.\n\u2013Green Dot: This seems to be pointing at a part of the intestineorarelated struc ture.\n\u2013Purple Dot: This is highlighting a section that could be either fatty tissueorconnec-\ntivetissue near the surgical area.\n\u2022response 3\n\u2013Yellow Dot: This appears to be a partoftheliver. The liver is a large, essential organ\nin the body responsible for various functions, including the production of bile.\n\u2013Red Dot: This denotes a surgicalinstrument, possiblyaclamp oraclipapplier. These\ninstruments are used to seal off blood vessels or ducts.\n\u2013Blue Dot: This seems to indicate the cysticduct, a duct that connects the gallbladder\nto the common bile duct.\n\u2013 Green Dot: The tissue indicated by the green dot looks like the gallbladder, a small\npear-shaped organ responsible for storing bile.\n\u2013Purple Dot: This might be pointing to a fatpadorconnectivetissuenear thegall-\nbladder, though it\u2019s a bit harder to identify precisely without clearer context. CASE 1\nComplex Descriptions\nPrompt: This is a photo of a laparoscopic gallbladder removal surgery. The gallbladder is connected\nto the liver, and the liver is usually around with fat. In the picture, there are five different colors\nmarking different tissues or instruments. Based on what can be seen under the laparoscopic view\nand the appearance of the organs, please tell me what each color represents.\nGPT-4V Response:\n\u2022response 1\n\u2013Blue Dot: This appears to represent the cysticduct. The cystic duct connects the\ngallbladder to the common bile duct and is a pathway for bile to flow in and out of\nthe gallbladder.\n\u2013Green dot: This likely represents the gallbladder. The gallbladder is a small, pear-\nshaped organ that stores bile produced by the liver.\n\u2013Red dot: This seems to indicate a laparoscopic instrument, likely being used for\ndissectionormanipulationofthenearby struc tures.\n\u2013Yellow dot: This might denote the liver\u2019s surface. The liver is responsible for\nproducing bile, among its many other functions.\n\u2013Purple dot: Given its position and appearance, this could either represent a portion\nof the liver orpossiblyassociated fatty tissue.\n\u2022response 2\n\u2013Blue Dot: This appears to be the cysticduct. It is the duct through which bile flows\nfrom the gallbladder and joins the common bile duct (which eventually drains into\nthe small intestine).\n\u2013Green dot: This likely represents the gallbladder itself. The gallbladder stores bile\nproduced by the liver.\n\u2013Red dot: This looks like a laparoscopic instrument, possibly a clipapplier ordissec-\ntor, being used to manipulate or dissect structures during the procedure.\n\u2013Yellow dot: This might represent the liver\u2019s surface. The liver is a vital organ that has\nmany functions, including producing bile.\n\u2013Purple dot: This could be another part of the liver orpossiblyfatty tissueassociated\nwith theliver.\n\u2022response 3\n\u2013Red dot: This seems to be an instrument, likely a grasper ordissector, being used to\nmanipulate or retract tissues during the surgery.\n\u2013Blue Dot: This appears to be the cysticduct or possibly the common bile duct. During\ngallbladder removal, the cystic duct is identified, clipped, and then cut.\n\u2013Yellow dot: This is likely theliver. The liver has a distinct appearance and is usually\neasily identifiable in laparoscopic surgeries involving the gallbladder.\n\u2013Green dot: This appears to be the gallbladderitself, which is the primary focus of\nthe surgery. The gallbladder stores bile produced by the liver and releases it into the\nsmall intestine.\n\u2013Purple dot: This might represent the surrounding fatty tissueorconnectivetissue\nknown astheomen tum or possibly the peritoneum, which lines the abdominal cavity. CASE 1\nConcise Description\nPrompt: This is a photo of a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The gallbladder is connected to the\nliver which is usually enveloped in fat. Tell me what instrument or tissue each color represents.\nGPT-4V Response:\n\u2022response 1\n\u2013Red dot: This appears to be pointing to an instrument, likely a laparoscopic grasper\nordissector, which is used to manipulate and separate tissues during the procedure.\n\u2013Yellow dot: It looks to be highlighting aportionoftheliver. The liver is a large,\nreddish-brown organ and its surface is shown here.\n\u2013Blue dot: This seems to be pointing to the gallbladder or possibly the cysticduct. It\u2019s\na part of the biliary system which is targeted during a cholecystectomy.\n\u2013Green dot: This may be indicating a portion of the omen tum or fattissue that\ntypically drapes over the organs in the abdominal cavity.\n\u2013Purple dot: This appears to be highlighting a section of the small intestine, specifi-\ncally, it could be a part of the duodenum or jejunum.\n\u2022response 2\n\u2013Red Dot: This appears to be pointing to an instrument, likely a laparoscopic dissector\norgrasper, commonly used during surgery to manipulate tissues and structures.\n\u2013Blue Dot: This is pointing to what looks like the gallbladder or a part of it. The\ngallbladder stores bile produced by the liver.\n\u2013Green Dot: This is pointing to a fleshy structure which might be a partoftheliver.\nThe liver is a large organ responsible for many vital functions including detoxification,\nprotein synthesis, and bile production.\n\u2013Yellow Dot: This seems to be pointing to the liver\u2019s surface or possibly an area of\nfatty tissuesurround ingtheliver.\n\u2013Purple Dot: This is pointing to what looks like a fold or sectionoftheintestines or\nomen tum, which is a fatty apron-like tissue hanging down from the stomach.\n\u2022response 3\n\u2013Yellow Dot: This appears to be the liver surface. The liver is a large, reddish-brown\norgan that sits just below the diaphragm. In laparoscopic cholecystectomies, the\nliver\u2019s surface is often visible.\n\u2013Blue Dot: This could be the gallbladderitself. In laparoscopic cholecystectomies, the\ngallbladder is targeted for removal, and it typically appears as a distended, fluid-filled\nsac.\n\u2013Green Dot: This might represent fat or connective tissue surrounding the gallbladder,\noften referred to as the omen tumortheperitoneal fat.\n\u2013Red Dot: This appears to be a surgical instrument, possibly a clipapplier orgrasper.\nThese instruments are used to manipulate tissues or apply clips to structures like the\ncystic duct or artery before they\u2019re cut.\n\u2013Purple Dot: This could be the cysticduct orthecysticartery. During a cholecystec-\ntomy, these structures are identified, clipped, and then cut to remove the gallbladder. 6.1.2 Case 2: CT image annotation recognition\nCASE 2\n\u2022Picture modal: CT section\n\u2022Tasks: Abdominal CT section\n\u2022Reference Answer:\n\u2013 Red Dot: Liver.\n\u2013 Yellow Dot: Pancrea.\n\u2013 Green Dot: Left kidney.\n\u2013 Blue Dot: Spleen.

CASE 2\nComplex Descriptions\nPrompt: This is a cross-sectional image of an abdominal CT scan. The central white highlighted\narea is the spine, and the outer white highlighted areas are the ribs. The top of the image is the\npatient\u2019s front, the bottom of the image is the patient\u2019s back, the right side of the image is the\npatient\u2019s left side, and the left side is the patient\u2019s right side. Within this image, there are four color\nannotations, with the 4 colors representing 4 different organs. What are these four organs\nGPT-4V Response:\n\u2022response 1\n\u2013Reddot:This appears tobelocated intheliver, given itssize, shape, andlocationin\ntheright upperquad rantwhen oriented with thepatient\u2019s right sidetotheleftofthe\nimage.\n\u2013Yellowdot:This appears tobethegallbladder. It\u2019s smaller and is often found nestled\nwithin the liver, which would be consistent with its position next to the red dot\nrepresenting the liver.\n\u2013Green dot:Based onitslocationtowards thepatient\u2019s leftsideandposteriorlylocated\nrelativetothespine, thisislikely theleftkidney.\n\u2013Blue dot: Based on its central location and anterior to the spine, this might represent\ntheaorta or another large vessel. However, without the full context and without being\na medical expert, I cannot definitively identify it.\n\u2022response 2\n\u2013Red dot:This appears tobelocated intheliver, given itslocationontheright side\n(left sideoftheimage) anditsproximitytothediaphragm.\n\u2013Green dot:This looks likethespleen based on its location on the left side (right side\nof the image) and its shape.\n\u2013Yellowdot:This appears tobethepancreas, which is centrally located and nestled\nbetween the stomach and the spine.\n\u2013Blue dot: Given its location on the left side of the patient (right side of the image)\nand below the spleen, this seems to represent the leftkidney.\n\u2022response 3\n\u2013Reddot:This seems tobeintheregion oftheliver given its location on the right side\n(patient\u2019s perspective) of the abdomen and its characteristic shape.\n\u2013Yellowdot:Located centrally andslightly totheleft(from thepatient\u2019s perspective),\nthisappears tobethepancreas.\n\u2013Green dot:This issituated more inferiorlyandslightly totheleft(patient\u2019s perspec-\ntive). Itcould represent theleftkidney given its shape and position relative to the\nspine.\n\u2013Blue dot:Located ontheright side(patient\u2019s perspective) andinferiorly, thisislikely\ntheright kidney. CASE 2\nConcise Description\nPrompt: This is a cross-sectional image of an abdominal CT scan.

The gallbladder is usually located under the liver,\nwhile the bowel is spread throughout the abdomen.\n\u2013Green dot: This is likely pointing to the spleen, which is normally located in the\nupper left quadrant of the abdomen, just under the rib cage.\n\u2013Blue dot: This could be the stomach or the leftkidney, which would be located just\nunder the spleen and toward the back of the abdominal cavity. The stomach would be\nmore towards the front.\n\u2022response 2\n\u2013Red dot: This could represent the liver, which is the large organ on the right side\nof the body (which appears on the left side of the image because MRI images are\ntypically viewed as if you are facing the patient).\n\u2013Yellow dot: This might indicate the spleen, which is located on the left side of the\nbody (appearing on the right side of the image), but it also could be the stomach,\ndepending on the exact location and the orientation of the slice.\n\u2013Green dot: This is possibly marking the pancreas, which is situated behind the\nstomach in the middle of the abdomen, but this depends on the green dot\u2019s precise\nposition.\n\u2013Blue dot: This could be indicative of either part of the bowel ortheleftkidney,\ndepending on its position relative to the spine and other structures.\n\u2022response 3\n\u2013Red dot: This could represent the liver, which is the largest organ in the upper right\nquadrant of the abdomen.\n\u2013Yellow dot: This might indicate the gallbladder if it\u2019s near the liver, or possibly part\nof the gastrointestinal tract.\n\u2013Green dot: This could be highlighting the spleen orapartofthebowel, depending\non its location relative to the abdominal anatomy.\n\u2013Blue dot: This could be indicating the pancreas, especially if it\u2019s located centrally\nand slightly posterior. CASE 3\nConcise Description\nPrompt: This is a cross-sectional image of an abdominal MRI scan. In the image, the locations of\nthe organs in MRI will be mirrored from their actual human anatomy, what are these four organs\nmarked by color.\nGPT-4V Response:\n\u2022response 1\n\u2013Red dot: This could represent the liver, which is the largest organ in the abdominal\ncavity and usually occupies a significant portion of the right upper quadrant.\n\u2013Yellow dot: This might indicate the pancreas, which is a retroperitoneal organ located\nbehind the stomach.\n\u2013Green dot: This might represent a section of the bowel orcolon, depending on its\nprecise location in the abdomen.\n\u2013Blue dot: This could be pointing to the spleen, which is located in the left upper\nquadrant of the abdomen.\n\u2022response 2\n\u2013Red dot: This could likely indicate the liver, given its location in the upper right\nquadrant of the abdomen (which would appear on the left side of the image due to\nmirroring).\n\u2013Yellow dot: This might point to the pancreas, given its location and orientation of the\nimage.\n\u2013Green dot: TThis could represent a structure in the lower abdomen, potentially part\nof the small intestine, orifitismore totheleft,itcould bepartofthecolon.\n\u2013Blue dot: This could be indicating the spleen if the dot is on the left side of the body\n(right side of the image), or possibly a kidney if it\u2019s more towards the back.\n\u2022response 3\n\u2013Red dot: This is likely to be indicating the liver, which is a large organ occupying\nthe right upper quadrant of the abdomen. In an MRI scan, the liver often shows up as\na large, homogenous area that is brighter on T2-weighted images.\n\u2013Yellow dot: This could be marking the pancreas, which is located in the central\npart of the abdomen, behind the stomach. The pancreas has a more heterogeneous\nappearance compared to the liver on MRI\n\u2013Green dot: This is possibly marking the spleen, which is located in the left upper\nquadrant of the abdomen, posterior to the stomach. It typically has a similar appear-\nance to the liver on MRI scans but is smaller in size.\n\u2013Blue dot: This might be indicating the leftkidney, which is located towards the\nback of the upper abdomen on either side of the spine. Kidneys are usually seen as\nbean-shaped structures on cross-sectional imaging. 6.2 Tip 2: Providing the tasks can better help analyze the images\n6.2.1 Case 1: Endoscopic operation analysis\nCASE 1\n\u2022Picture modal: Endoscopic picture\n\u2022Tasks: Hysteroscopic resection of uterine fibroids\n\u2022Reference Answer:\n\u2013 Tool: loop electrode/resectoscope loop/myoma loop.\n\u2013 Purpose: cut fibroids from the uterus lining and stop bleeding simultaneously. CASE 1\nControl group\nPrompt: Please tell me what the silver surgical instrument in the picture is and its purpose.\nGPT-4V Response:\n\u2022response 1: The image shows a certain surgery being performed under arthroscopy. From\nthe image, surgical instruments can be seen, one of which looks like a clamp ormanipulator.\nRegarding the specific type of surgical instrument, I cannot be completely sure, as this\ndepends on the specific purpose and context of the surgery. Arthro scopic surgeries are\ngenerallyused fordiagnosingandtreatingjoint problems, especially intheknee, shoul der,\nandother majorjoints. The purpose of this instrument may include manipulatingtissues,\nexcisingdamaged tissues, clamp ingcertainobjects, etc., depending on the purpose of the\nsurgery.\n\u2022response 2: The image shows a scene from an endoscopic surgery. The surgical instrument\nlooks like a ring-shaped grasper orclamp. This type ofinstrument istypically used to\ngrasp, excise, ormanipulatetissueinarthro scopic orother endoscopic surgeries. The red\narea in the picture might be tissue inside the joint cavity, and the white structures might be\nbone or cartilage, but this requires more detailed background information to determine.\nThe specific purpose of this instrument depends on the type and purpose of the surgery,\nsuch as in knee arthroscopy, it might be used toexcisedamaged cartilage orrepairinjured\nligaments.\n\u2022response 3: The image shows an instrument used in an arthro scopic surgery.

This mask appears to cover the area\nof the liver without including other adjacent organs or structures, which aligns with the\ntypical anatomical location of the liver as shown in the MRI image.\n\u2022response 3: The images provided show a series of masks corresponding to segments in an\nMRI scan. To identify which mask corresponds to the liver in the MRI scan, one would\nlook for the shape and location that matches the liver\u2019s appearance and anatomical position\nin the lower image.\nIn the MRI scan, the liver is typically located in the upper right quadrant of the abdomen,\njust under the diaphragm. It appears as a large, dark mass on T2-weighted images like the\none shown, due to its relatively homogeneous texture compared to other organs and tissues\nwhich may appear brighter due to higher water content.\nComparing the shapes and positions in the masks to the liver in the MRI:\nMask 1 shows a large area that extends across the midline, which is not characteristic of\nthe liver\u2019s location.\nMask 2 shows a large area that is positioned to the right but extends too far to the left,\nwhich is not typical for the liver.\nMask 3 shows a smaller area positioned on the right side only, which could be a closer\nmatch to the typical location of the liver.\nGiven this information and without more specific details about the orientation and type of\nMRI sequence, Mask 3seems tobethemost likely candidate thatcorresponds totheliver,\nconsidering only the red part of the mask. However, such assessments are best confirmed\nby a medical professional with expertise in radiology. CASE 3\nStep-by-step guidance (single round)\nPrompt: Picture 123 is the mask template for the liver(the red part), and Picture 4 is an image of an\nabdominal MRI section, please tell me the location of the liver in picture 4.\nPlease tell me the location of the livers in picture 1 2 3\nWhich mask would correspond to Picture 4\nGPT-4V Response:\n\u2022response 1: In picture 4, the liver is the large, darker area that takes up the upper part\nof the abdomen on the right side (from the perspective of the image, which would be the\npatient\u2019s left side since MRI images are typically mirrored).\nRegarding pictures 1, 2, and 3, each of them shows a red area that represents the liver\u2019s\nlocation as a mask on a black background. Here\u2019s how they would match:\n\u2013Picture 1 shows a mask where the liver is represented in the correct anatomical\nposition, extending across the right side of the image with segments appearing on the\nleft side.\n\u2013Picture 2 has a similar representation, with the liver\u2019s position slightly more central-\nized but still predominantly on the right side.\n\u2013 Picture 3 depicts the liver significantly smaller and more to the central and left side,\nwhich is less typical for a standard anatomical position.\nFor picture 4, the mask that would correspond to the MRI image would be the one that\nshows the liver in the anatomical position that matches the dark area on the MRI. This\nwould most likely bethemask from picture 1, as it covers the area where the liver is\ntypically located and appears to be the correct size and shape to match the liver\u2019s appearance\nin an axial MRI section.\n\u2022response 2: In the provided MRI image, the liver is located in the upper right quadrant\nof the abdomen. It appears as a prominent, dark area in the scan, situated just below the\ndiaphragm and to the right of where the stomach would be, which is usually less distinct\nin an MRI. The masks in Pictures 1, 2, and 3 offer abstract representations of the liver\u2019s\nlocation and shape within the human body, following a color-coded template.\nThe liver\u2019s relative position is consistent across the masks, although the shapes differ due\nto individual anatomical variations or the specific liver section shown.\n\u2013Picture 1 mask shows a large red area on the right, corresponding to the liver\u2019s\nposition from the viewer\u2019s perspective.\n\u2013 Picture 2 mask has a similar red area representing the liver.\n\u2013Picture 3 presents a smaller red section, suggesting a different or smaller liver portion.\nDetermining the most accurate mask for Picture 4 depends on the MRI\u2019s orientation and\nsection. The liver is the largest solid organ with a distinctive shape, so the correct mask\nwould closely resemble the large, dark area on the right side of the MRI image. Picture\n1islikely themost accuraterepresentation, with itsextensiveredarea align ingwith the\nliver\u2019s visiblesectionintheMRI.\n\u2022response 3: The liver in an abdominal MRI, like Picture 4, is located on the upper right\nfrom the viewer\u2019s angle, corresponding to the patient\u2019s left, and shows up as a large, darker\narea.\nFor Pictures 1, 2, and 3, the red overlay marks the liver differently: to the left, centered\nwith a right lean, and mainly on the right, respectively.\nDetermining which mask aligns with Picture 4 depends on the MRI\u2019s plane\u2014axial, coronal,\nor sagittal. Visually, Picture 1\u2019sredoverlaylooks most liketheliver inPicture 4, but\ndefinitive matching requires specialized software to consider the liver\u2019s 3D shape and\nposition.

However, the speed of growth varies and cannot\ndefinitively diagnose the type.\n\u2013Infectious causes: Some infections can cause nodules that grow or change over time.\nExamples include fungal infections such as aspergillosis or coccidioidomycosis.\n\u2013Benign tumors: While benign tumors such as hamartomas or fibromas are typically\nslow-growing, they can still increase in size over time.\n\u2013Inflammatory conditions: Conditions such as rheumatoid nodules or granulomatous\ndiseases can also present as lung nodules. The growth pattern might help differentiate\nbetween the different possibilities.\n\u2013Metastatic cancers: A lung nodule can be a metastasis from a primary tumor\nelsewhere in the body.\n\u2022response 2:\n\u2013Lung Cancer: Primary lung cancer is the most concerning possibility for a pro-\ngressively enlarging nodule in the lung. Itcould benon-small celllung cancer(e.g.,\nadenocarcinoma, squamous cellcarcinoma) orsmall celllung cancer.\n\u2013Infectious Causes: Some infections can cause nodules in the lung that can grow\nover time. This includes bacterial infections like tuberculosis, fungal infections like\naspergillosis or histoplasmosis, or parasitic infections like echinococcosis.\n\u2013Benign Tumors: Some benign lung tumors, such as hamartomas or fibromas, can\nalso grow, although at a slower rate than malignant ones.\n\u2013 Inflammatory Diseases: Conditions like granulomatosis with polyangiitis, rheuma-\ntoid nodules in the context of rheumatoid arthritis, and sarcoidosis can cause lung\nnodules.\n\u2013Metastases: If the patient has a history of cancer elsewhere in the body, it\u2019s possible\nthat the nodule represents metastatic disease.\n\u2022response 3:\n\u2013Lung Cancer: One ofthemost concerningpossibilitiesforaslow -grow ingpul-\nmonary noduleislung cancer,likeadenocarcinoma.

This\nregion may signify a potential anomaly or lesion. However, the precise nature and clinical\nsignificance necessitate a more comprehensive medical evaluation for determination.\n\u2022response 2: In the MRI image you\u2019ve presented, there appears to be a hyperintense area in\ntheupperleftsection, contrasting with the adjacent cerebral tissue. This could indicate the\npresence of a lesion or abnormality.\n\u2022response 3: On the MRI image you provided, a hyperintense region isdiscernible inthe\nupperleftquad rant. Based on the image, this region seems to deviate from the typical\ncerebral tissue presentation. From this observation, the region may represent an aberration. 6.10.2 Case 2: PET scan for lung cancer detection\nCASE 2\n\u2022Picture modal: PET scan\n\u2022Tasks: Cancer detection\n\u2022Reference Answer: Lung cancer CASE 2\nControl Group\nPrompt: Please describe this PET scan and tell me what disease is most likely involved in this\npicture (only answer the most likely one)\nGPT-4V Response:\n\u2022response 1: The scan shows several areas of increased tracer uptake, which are the bright\nspots in the image. The areas of high uptake of the tracer suggest a higher level of metabolic\nactivity, which is commonly associated with cancer cells that are more active than normal\ncells.\nGiven themultiplebright spots ofvaryingsizes through outthebody, thispatternmay be\nindicativeofawidespread metastatic disease, where cancercells from anoriginaltumor\nhave spread toother parts ofthebody.\n\u2022response 2: The scan shows several areas of high uptake, which are visible as bright spots.\nThese bright spots indicate areas where a large amount of the tracer has accumulated,\nwhich often signifies a high level of metabolic activity that is typical of rapidly dividing\ncells, such as cancer cells. Given themultiplebright spots ofvaryingsizes, which canbe\nseen through outthebody, thispatterncould suggestmetastatic cancer,where thecancer\nhasspread tomultiplelocations.\n\u2022response 3: The bright areas in the head, chest, and abdomen could indicate areas of high\nmetabolic activity, which is often associated with cancer, as cancer cells have a higher\nmetabolic rate than normal cells. However, it\u2019s essential to consider the clinical context as\nthese findings can also be seen in infection, inflammation, or benign tumors. Given the\nmultiple areas of uptake, if this is indeed a pathological finding, it would suggest metastatic\ndisease.\nOne ofthemost common diseases thatcould cause widespread increased uptake ona\nPET scan ismetastatic cancer, where the primary cancer has spread to multiple locations\nthroughout the body. CASE 2\nControl Group\nPrompt: Focusing on the chest, please describe this PET scan and tell me what disease is most\nlikely involved in this picture (only answer the most likely one)\nGPT-4V Response:\n\u2022response 1: Focusing on the chest area, there are at least two distinct areas of increased\ntracer uptake. One is located in the region that would correspond to the mediastinum,\nwhich is the central part of the thorax. The other is in the region that might correspond to\nthe lung or pleura.\nGiven thepresence ofthese bright spots inthechest, themost likely disease involved\nislung cancer,possiblywith mediastinalinvolve ment which could suggest lymph node\nmetas tasis. However, other possibilities like lymphoma or infections could also present\nwith increased uptake in these areas, but these are less likely based on the singular bright\nspots seen in the image. It is important to note that a definitive diagnosis would require\ncorrelation with the patient\u2019s clinical history, physical examination, and other diagnostic\nstudies. A biopsy would be necessary to confirm the type of cancer or disease.\n\u2022response 2: In the chest area of this scan, there are multiple areas that show increased\ntracer uptake (highlighted as bright spots). The presence of multiple bright spots can be\nassociated with several conditions, but given that they are scattered throughout the chest,\nthemost likely disease involved here ismetastatic cancer. Metastases in the chest can arise\nfrom primary cancers located in the chest (like lung cancer) or from cancers that originated\nin other parts of the body and have spread to the chest.\n\u2022response 3: In this particular PET scan image, there are multiple areas of increased\nradiotracer uptake (hypermetabolic activity) in the region of the chest. The most prominent\nhypermetabolic activity is noted centrally in the chest area, which could represent the\nmediastinum, the area between the lungs that contains the heart, great vessels, trachea,\nesophagus, and lymph nodes.\nGiven that there is focal, intense uptake in the chest without clear visualization of the\nsurrounding anatomical structures, themost likely diagnosisinthisscenario would bea\nmediastinaltumor. The most common type of mediastinal tumor that would show up on\na PET scan is a lymphoma, especially if the hypermetabolic activity is associated with\nlymph nodes. "}
