In this study, we aim to assess the\nperformance of OpenAI\u2019s newest model, GPT-4V(ision), specifically in the realm of multimodal medical\ndiagnosis . Our evaluation encompasses 17human body systems, including Central Nervous System,\nHead and Neck, Cardiac, Chest, Hematology, Hepatobiliary, Gastrointestinal, Urogenital, Gynecology,\nObstetrics, Breast, Musculoskeletal, Spine, Vascular, Oncology, Trauma, Pediatrics, with images taken\nfrom 8modalities used in daily clinic routine, e.g., X-ray, Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic\nResonance Imaging (MRI), Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA),\nMammography, Ultrasound, and Pathology. We probe the GPT-4V\u2019s ability on multiple clinical tasks with\nor without patent history provided, including imaging modality and anatomy recognition, disease diagnosis,\nreport generation, disease localisation.\nOur observation shows that, while GPT-4V demonstrates proficiency in distinguishing between medical\nimage modalities and anatomy, it faces significant challenges in disease diagnosis and generating com-\nprehensive reports. These findings underscore that while large multimodal models have made significant\nadvancements in computer vision and natural language processing, it remains far from being used to\neffectively support real-world medical applications and clinical decision-making.\nAll images used in this report can be found in https://github.com/chaoyi-wu/GPT-4V_Medical_Evaluation .\nContents\n1 Introduction

Introduction\nLarge language models (LLMs), particularly the GPT series developed by OpenAI, have demonstrated\nremarkable capabilities across a wide spectrum of domains, even in specialized fields such as medicine and\nlaw [20,3,19,9]. While prior models in the GPT series have demonstrated potential in medical related\nlanguage tasks [ 17,21,8], even achieving high performance in the United States Medical Licensing Examination\n(USMLE), they are fundamentally limited in daily clinical routine, due to its inability to read visual signals.\nInspired by this, in medical community, many visual or multimodal foundation models [ 12] are also emerging,\ne.g., for fundus [27], pathology [10], radiology [23] or general medical images [26, 22, 13].\nSince September, the latest version, GPT-4V [ 24], starts to support multimodal input, sparking curiosity\nabout its effectiveness from the moment it became available for use. In this report, we aim to initiate a study\non the capabilities of GPT-4V for multimodal medical diagnosis, by asking the question: \u201cCan GPT-4V\nserve medical applications?\u201d This is a question of paramount importance, not only for the AI community,\nbut also for clinicians, patients, and healthcare administrators.\n1.1 Motivation.\nIn this report, our goal is to initiate a systematic evaluation of the capabilities of GPT-4V on multimodal\nmedical diagnosis. Specifically, we perform the case-level study from 17human body systems, including Central\nNervous System, Head and Neck, Cardiac, Chest, Hematology, Hepatobiliary, Gastrointestinal, Urogenital,\nGynecology, Obstetrics, Breast, Musculoskeletal, Spine, Vascular, Oncology, Trauma, Pediatrics, with images\ntaken from 8modalities, e.g., X-ray, Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI),\nPositron Emission Tomography (PET), Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA), Mammography, Ultrasound,\nand Pathology.\nOur exploration of GPT-4V is guided by the following questions.\n\u2022Can GPT-4V recognize the modalities and anatomical structures of medical images?\nRecognizing various modalities (such as X-ray, CT, MRI, ultrasound, and pathology) and identifying\ndifferent anatomical structures within these images lies the foundation for more sophisticated diagnosis.\n\u2022Can GPT-4V localize different anatomical structures in the medical image? Precisely\nlocalizing specific anatomical structures in an image is crucial for identifying abnormalities, ensuring\nthat potential issues are addressed in the correct anatomical context.\n\u2022Can GPT-4V discover and localize anomalies in medical images? Detecting anomalies, such as\ntumors, fractures, or infections, is a primary goal of medical image analysis. For an AI model to be\nconsidered reliable in a clinical setting, it is required to not only discover these abnormalities but also\naccurately localize them, facilitating targeted interventions or treatments.\n\u2022Can GPT-4V combine multiple images to make a diagnosis? Medical diagnoses often require a\nholistic view, combining information from different imaging modalities or views. It is thus critical to\nprobe GPT-4V\u2019s ability to combine and analyze information from multiple images.\n\u2022Can GPT-4V write medical reports, describing both abnormalities and relevant normal\nfindings? Writing reports is a time-intensive task for radiologists and pathologist. If GPT-4V can\nassist in this process by generating accurate and clinically relevant reports, it will certainly improve the\nefficiency of the entire workflow.\n\u2022Can GPT-4V integrate patient medical history when interpreting medical images? The\npatient\u2019s basic information and past medical history can greatly influence the interpretation of current\nmedical images. Considering this information during model prediction would lead to a more personalized\nand potentially more accurate analysis, considering all relevant patient-specific factors.\n\u2022Can GPT-4V maintain consistency and memory across multiple rounds of interaction? In\nsome medical scenarios, a single-pass analysis may not be sufficient. This capability of maintaining\n|8 a. Medical systems\nb. Imaging modalities\nFigure 1 |The Diagram of Medical Systems and Imaging Modalities. In this paper we comprehensively consider 17\nmedical systems (Figure a) and our cases can cover 8different imaging modalities (Figure b),i.e., X-ray, CT, MRI, PET, DSA,\nMammography, Ultrasound, Pathology from left to right.\na coherent and reliable context throughout extended conversations or analyses, especially in intricate\nmedical contexts where data continuity is critical.\n1.2 Sample selection.\nGuided by the aforementioned questions, we perform comprehensive case studies on various tasks. For radiology\nimage recognition, diagnosis and report generation, we leverage the most famous radiology collection website,\nRadiopaedia\u2217. For pathology image analysis, we collect hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained histopathology\nimages of malignant tumors across 20 tissues from the professional pathology website, PathologyOutlines\u2020.\nFor localization capability analysis, we choose samples from several public medical image segmentation and\ndetection benchmarks [11, 5, 4, 2, 15, 16, 6, 18, 1, 25, 14, 7].\n1.2.1 Case selection.\nGiven GPT-4V has not provided APIs officially, we can only use its webpage version, thus set limitations\non the scalability of our evaluation. In order to pick the most suitable cases, we mainly take the following\nconsiderations:\n\u2217https://radiopaedia.org/\n\u2020https://www.pathologyoutlines.com/\n|9 \u2022Release time. Considering that GPT-4V has been extensively trained on web data, to guarantee fair\nevaluation on its generalisation, we only select cases that have appeared online in 2023, to avoid the\ndata sample being part of the training set of GPT-4V.\n\u2022Reliability of annotations. Medical diagnosis normally requires strong expertise, it is crucial to\nselect samples with reliable annotations. Luckily, on Radiopaedia, each uploaded case is commonly\nreviewed by a board of radiologist\u2021, and accompanied by a completion ratio that indicates the sufficiency\nof information for diagnosis. We typically select cases with a completion ratio exceeding 90% as their\nreference descriptions are deemed more reliable.\n\u2022Diverse imaging modalities. For each body system, we aim to include a wide spectrum of imaging\nmodalities available, while also reflecting the real-world distribution of images as accurately as possible.\nConsequently, foreverysystem, weendeavortoencompassallthecasesacrossdifferentimagingmodalities\nrelated to that body system. It\u2019s worth noting that we also pick cases that requires to integrate multiple\nimaging modalities for decision making.\n1.2.2 Image processing.\nHere, we describe the rules to control the quality of input images:\n\u2022Multi-image selection. Many entries on Radiopaedia may contain more than four images, exceeding\nthe upper input limitation for GPT-4V. Typically, we refrain from using such entries, as manually\nselecting images could result in omitting crucial ones. Nonetheless, on rare occasions, we might encounter\nthis challenge. When faced with this situation, we will prioritize the four images that most closely align\nwith the descriptions provided on Radiopaedia for input.\n\u2022Key slice selection. In medical imaging analysis, the data is usually represented as 3D volume.\nHowever, the current GPT-4V model is limited to only processing four image inputs per time maximally,\nwhich is notably smaller than the standard number of slices in medical 3D data, like CT and MRI scans.\nGiven this constraint, we use the slice\u00a7that is most relevant to the case description and diagnosis, as\nsuggested by expert radiologists while uploading images onto Radiopaedia website.\n\u2022Intensity normalization. For medical images, varying-intensity windows can reveal different structures.\nWe utilize the default intensity window displayed on Radiopaedia, as set by the radiologists, for image\ninput. For localization tasks, we clip the CT images at [-300, 300], while clip other images at the 0.5%\nand 99.5% percentiles of the intensity distribution. All the images are the rescaled to [0, 1].\n1.2.3 Question prompts.\nFor each case, we might pose various questions spanning multiple tasks, but our primary emphasis is on report\ngeneration and diagnosis. The question prompt for the same task may vary slightly with each inquiry, to test\nthe robustness of GPT-4V on responding different text query formats. For example, for report generation, we\nmay often use the prompts as \u201cPlease Generate a radiology report for this images.\u201d or\u201cMay you please write\na report for the patient?\u201d and for diagnosis, we may often use \u201cCan you make a diagnosis for the patient?\u201d or\n\u201cAre there any abnormalities in the images?\u201d . For other types of questions, we will organize conversation freely\nwithout recommended prompts.\n1.2.4 Annotation or reference caption.\nIn order to reduce the difficulty of checking the correctness of the GPT-4V responses, we have selected the\nimage descriptions provided on Radiopaedio as references, which has been verified by a board of qualified\nradiologists. However, it\u2019s crucial to note that the references are not in standard format of clinical reports.\nThe radiologists write about what captures their interest, potentially overlooking many standard statements.\n\u2021https://radiopaedia.org/editors\n\u00a7https://radiopaedia.org/articles/key-image\n|10 In other words, the description guarantees its accuracy but cannot ensure a comprehensive description of the\npatient\u2019s condition. Therefore, in case analysis, only statements that directly conflict with the given reference\nwill be marked as definite incorrect. For all other output information, it\u2019s up to the readers to judge its\ncorrectness with expertise knowledge.\n1.3 Testing procedure.\nWe evaluate GPT-4V using its online chat page\u00b6. We begin the conversation by feeding in the images.\nTypically, we might pose one or two questions for each case, with subsequent questions as multi-round\nconversation. When turning to a new case, we initiate a fresh chat window to ensure GPT-4V doesn\u2019t\nmistakenly leverage information from previous conversations related to other cases.\nFor pathology evaluation, two-round conversations are exploited across all images. The first round asks\nwhether a report can be generated base on only the input image. The purpose of this round is to evaluate\nwhether GPT-4V can recognize image modalities and tissue origin without given any related medical prompts.\nAt the second round, we provide the correct tissue origin and ask whether GPT-4V can make a diagnosis\nbased on both the pathology image and the information of its tissue origin. We expect GPT-4V to modify its\nreport and provide a clear diagnostic result.\nIn localization evaluation, we follow a step-by-step manner: we first test whether GPT-4V recognizes the\npresence of the target in the provided image; then we ask it to generate the bounding box coordinates of the\ntarget, based on the top-left corner of the image is (x, y) = (0, 0) and the bottom-right corner is (x, y) = (w,\nh). We repeat the evaluation for each single localization task several times to get at least 4 predicted bounding\nboxes, calculate their IOU scores and pick the highest one to demonstrate its upper-bound performance; We\nthen derive the averaged bounding box and calculate the IOU score to demonstrate its averaged performance.\nIn particular, we notice that asking GPT-4V to identify the presence of abnormality may trigger its safeguard\nmechanism and cause it not answer or generate coordinate in further conversation. We thus directly ask it to\nlocalize the provided abnormality under such situations.\n1.4 Case demonstration.\nWe show each evaluation cases in one figure as Fig. 2. \u201cPrompt\u201d represents the sentence or images input by the\nusers. \u201cGPT-4V\u201d denotes GPT-4V\u2019s response. Note that, with the safeguard mechanism, GPT-4V tends to\nalways claim its incompetence as a radiologist, we will omit these declarations by default for better readability.\n\u201cReference answer\u201d denotes the reference indicated according to the descriptions provided by the Radiopaedio.\nWe employ redto emphasize incorrect statements in GPT-4V\u2019s responses. The same color in the reference\nanswer indicates the basis upon which we deem the response incorrect. Similarly, greenis used to highlight\ncorrect content and the same color in reference indicating the sentences used to judge, and yellowis reserved\nfor content that is uncertain or ambiguous.\nEach case in localization evaluation is demonstrated in a figure as Fig. 3. We visualise the generated bounding\nboxes ingreen, the averaged bounding box in red, and the ground-truth segmentation / bounding box in\nblue. To highlight the region of interesting, we slightly lower the intensity of the input image in visualization.\n1.5 Limitations of this report\nHere, we discuss several limitations in our evaluation of GPT-4V for multimodal medical diagnosis.\n\u2022Only qualitative evaluation. Given GPT-4V only provides online webpage interface, we can only\nmanually upload test cases, causing this evaluation report to be limited on scalability, thus only\nqualitative evaluation can be provided.\n\u2022Sample bias. The selected samples are sourced from the online website, which may not reflect the\ndata distribution in daily clinic routine. Specifically, most evaluation cases are abnormal cases, that\nmay introduce potential bias in our evaluation.\n\u00b6https://chat.openai.com/\n|11 Central Nervous System: Case 3 cont. \nGenerate a radiology report for these abnormal brain MRIs.Prompt \nBrain MRI -Axial and Sagittal Views\nClinical Indication: Not provided.\nTechnique: Multiple sequences of axial and sagittal images of the brain.\nFindings:\n1.Brain Parenchyma: The brain parenchyma appears largely intact.

The reference reports obtained from the Radiopae-\ndia/PathologyOutlines website are mostly unstructured, and not of standardized radiology/pathology\nreport formatting. In particular, a majority of these reports primarily focus on describing abnormalities\nrather than providing comprehensive descriptions of the cases.\n\u2022Only 2D slice input. In real clinical settings, radiological images, including CT, MRI scans, are\ntypically in the 3D DICOM format, however, as GPT-4V only supports up to four 2D images as input,\nwe can only feed in 2D key slices or small patches (for pathology).\nIn summary, while our evaluation may not be exhaustive, we believe that this analysis offers valuable insights\n|12 Figure 3 |A Demonstration Case for Localization Evaluation . The upper image is the input to GPT-4V, while the\nbottom image visualize the predictions and ground-truth. The generated bounding boxes are in green, the averaged bounding\nbox is in red, and the ground-truth segmentation / bounding box is in blue. To highlight the region of interesting, we slightly\nlower the intensity of the input image in visualization.\nfor both researchers and medical professionals, it sheds light on the current capabilities of the multimodal\nfoundational model and may inspire future work towards building medical foundation models.\n2 Observations\nIn this section, we provide a summary of the observations from our case studies, following the questions\nlisted in Sec. 1.1. Our evaluation encompasses a comprehensive assessment of VQA, report generation, and\ndisease diagnosis tasks on radiology images, covering a total of 92 cases obtained from 17 systems, which\ncollectively involve 266 images. Additionally, we delve into a detailed evaluation of 12 specific localization\n|13 tasks in Sec. 3.18.\nMoreover, for pathology images, we also evaluate report generation and medical diagnosis tasks, conducting\npatch-level studies encompassing 20 distinct malignant tumors from different tissues. The specific observations\nof pathology images are provided in detail in Sec. 4.\n2.1 GPT-4V can recognize the modality and anatomy of medical images.\nModality Recognition. For most cases we examined, GPT-4V is able to recognize the imaging modality\ncorrectly, as indicated by the following examples, Mammography (Figs. 62 and 93), X-ray (Figs. 10, 17, 48, 50,\n53, 56, 59, 79, 80 and 85), CT( Figs. 16, 21 and 82), MRI (Figs. 18, 53, 61, 81 and 119), Ultrasound (Figs. 15,\n58 and 67), Nuclear Imaging (Fig. 83), Pathology (Figs. 140 to 159). Nonetheless, there remains cases where\nthe model faces challenges in determining the modality. For instances, in Fig. 66, there is uncertainty in\ndetermining whether the input is MRI or CT. However, given that MRIs are rarely used for breast imaging,\nsuch hesitation is acceptable.\nAnatomy Recognition. In the majority of evaluated samples, GPT-4V can correctly identify the tar-\nget anatomical structures, as indicated by the following examples, Head and Neck (Figs. 16, 18 and 19),\nSpine (Figs. 80 to 82 and 84 to 86), Breast (Figs. 62 to 64 and 67), Chest and Cardiac (Figs. 30 and 48),\nAbdomen and Pelvis (Figs. 47, 50, 52, 54, 56 and 79), Musculoskeletal (Figs. 46 and 74), Vascular (Figs. 88\nand 90) and Others (Figs. 10, 59 and 61). In cases involving multiple images, GPT-4V can identify which\nbody parts in the images require special attention and analyze them separately, even if the analysis turns out\nto be incorrect, as indicated by Fig. 28. However, in Fig. 53, GPT-4V misclassified Pelvic MRI as knee MRI.\nPlane Recognition. GPT-4V has shown promising performance in distinguishing various imaging planes,\nbe it sagittal, axial, or coronal, as evidenced in Figs. 16, 23, 37, 47, 60 to 62, 79, 81, 82, 84, 98 and 100.\nIt can even distinguish the imaging axial correctly (mediolateral oblique (MLO) or craniocaudal (CC) for\nmammography) as shown in Fig. 62. While in Figs. 18, 52 and 53, GPT-4V fails to predict the plane of the\nfirst image.\n2.2 GPT-4V can hardly make accurate diagnoses.\nOpenAI seems to have set strong safe guard system, to strictly avoid the GPT-4V to make direct diagnosis.\nAs shown in Figs. 4, 8, 10, 17, 58, 62 and 63, GPT-4V may refuse to give clear diagnosis conclusion. While\nfor most cases it responds, GPT-4V is still far away from meeting the demand for clinical diagnosis, it\nsimply lists out different diseases based on general medicial knowledge, instead of diagnosing the images of\ninterest (Figs. 21, 83 and 143), or fails completely (Fig. 68). In several cases, where the contrast between\nnormal and abnormal areas is very significant, it can localize the abnormality Figs. 48 and 71. This is a\nsignificant limitation given the critical importance of accurate diagnostics in the medical field.\n2.3 GPT-4V can generate structured reports, with incorrect content.\nWe probe GPT-4V\u2019s ability to generate medical reports with illustrative examples covering various anatomical\nareas, for example, Head and Neck (Figs. 18 and 19), Spine (Figs. 80 and 81), Breast (Figs. 62 and 64), Chest\nand and Cardiac (Figs. 24, 28 and 33), Abdomen and Pelvis (Figs. 36, 47, 49, 50, 52, 54, 56, 79 and 86),\nMusculoskeletal (Fig. 34), Vascular (Fig. 87), Oncology (Fig. 93).\nIt can be observed that GPT-4V always generates reports in a structured template, unlike manually written\nclinical reports, which tend to be more flexible in content. For instance, in the case of mammography\nreport generation, GPT-4V will always response term by term, even though most listed aspects in the\nreport are normal and nothing worth noting. However, when facing the input consisting of various imaging\nmodalities (Figs. 67 and 81), it may fail to write typical reports, degrading to picture-by-picture descriptions,\nand cannot give a comprehensive conclusion combining all images.\nOverall, despite the reports generated by GPT-4V are structured and generally consider the anatomical\nregions of interest, the report content is not always correct.\n|14 2.4 GPT-4V can recognize text and markers in images, but lacks understanding.\nGPT-4V shows the ability of Optical Character Recognition (OCR), i.e., extracting and interpreting text\nfrom images (Figs. 49, 57, 65 and 99). For such cases, GPT-4V may focus on the textual content and overlook\nthe image content itself, as observed in Figs. 91 and 92. As indicated by Figs. 24 to 26 and 121, it can be\nobserved that the text or markers in images tends to pose significant effects on the model\u2019s prediction.\nIn addition, GPT-4V is able to recognize and interpret various visual markers in medical images, such as\narrows (Figs. 35, 47 and 158) and circles, which can direct the model to identify and analyze regions of\ninterest, providing valuable cues for diagnostic process. When text annotations are added next to the arrows,\nas shown in Fig. 30, GPT-4V is capable of accurately recognizing the text and presenting a complete and\naccurate radiology report.\nIt is important to note that despite the strong OCR ability in GPT-4V, its robustness requires to be further\nimproved, as it may also fail to recognize the text on the image (Fig. 90) or mis-interpret the medical\nannotations on images (Fig. 65).\n2.5 GPT-4V can identify medical devices and their locations in images.\nGPT-4V shows satisfying performance in accurately identifying medical devices in various modal images and\nindicating their location, as highlighted in Figs. 22, 33 and 115. This may suggest that GPT-4V is more\nsensitive to relatively obtrusive objects since they have more distinguishing features than pathological ones.\n2.6 GPT-4V faces difficulties on analyzing multiple images.\nWhen multiple images of different modalities are used as input, GPT-4V always tends to analyze each image\nseparately (Figs. 5, 14, 16, 18, 31, 38, 51, 52, 54, 60, 61 and 101). In most cases, it clearly recognizes the\nnumber of input images and describes their contents comprehensively, regardless of whether the input images\nare of same imaging modality, as shown in Figs. 31, 82 and 106. However, we also find if the input images hit\nthe limitation, i.e., four images, GPT-4V may ignore the text context (Figs. 105 and 107).\n2.6.1 Multiple images with different views within the same modality.\nWhen the images given are different views of the same modality (axial, coronal, sagittal), GPT-4V is able\nto recognize the corresponding views. GPT-4V tends to provide separate descriptions for each view within\nthe findings section (Fig. 37), rather than describing them with structured templates. Occasionally, it can\nconclude its analysis into a comprehensive diagnosis within the impression section, as exemplified in Fig. 52.\nNotably, when GPT-4V understands the inherent relationship between different viewpoints, it can indeed\nachieve significantly better results than with a single view, as shown in Fig. 117.\n2.6.2 Multiple images from different modalities.\nWhen presented with images from different modalities, it is more challenging for the model to make a diagnosis,\neven when it is told the images are of different modalities for the same anatomy (Fig. 27). As a result, when\nconfronted with multiple images, it can not effectively leverage the contextual information provided by the\nother modalities.\n2.7 GPT-4V\u2019s prediction heavily relies on patient\u2019s medical history.\nThe inclusion of patient information and medical history within the prompt has a notable impact on the\noutput of the model, as illustrated in Figs. 17 to 19, 50 and 58. Textual information can help GPT-4V focus\non specific areas of interest, making it easier to obtain accurate results, as demonstrated in Figs. 35 and 89.\nWhen these contextual details are absent, the model tends to give prediction with normalcy diagnosis, when\npresented with a medical image (Fig. 96). In contrast, when comprehensive patient information and medical\nhistory are provided, the model demonstrates the ability to make inferences about potential abnormalities\nwithin the image, drawing upon the patient\u2019s past medical conditions to inform its response (Fig. 97).\n|15 2.8GPT-4V cannot localize the anatomical structures or anomalies in medical images.\nAs shown in Fig. 124 to Fig. 139, GPT-4V shows poor performance on localizing the anatomical structures or\nanomalies in medical images. We draw such conclusion based on the following observations: (i) GPT-4V can\ngenerate irrational bounding boxes far away from the ground-truth, getting 0.0 IOU scores in every turns\nof prediction, shown in Figs. 127, 138 and 139; (ii) even though GPT-4V sometimes gives an acceptable\nprediction in one turn, it shows high variance after repeating the evaluation for several times, thus the averaged\nbounding box gets a low IOU score, as shown in Figs. 124 and 128 to 130; (iii) GPT-4V shows strong bias in\ncertain situations, such as the sacrum is at the bottom of Spine MRI images and cerebellum is at the bottom\nof Brain MRI images. Thus it will make predictions regardless of the input images, as shown in Fig. 132 and\nFig. 134; (iv) the averaged IOU score of all cases is only 0.16, which is far from being reliable .\n2.9 GPT-4V can change answers with guidance in multi-round interaction.\nWith proper guidance, as illustrated in Figs. 33, 53, 121 and 122, GPT-4V can modify its responses to be\ncorrect over a series of interactions. For example, in the case shown in Fig. 53, we input the MRI images of\nendometriosis. GPT-4V initially misclassified Pelvic MRI as knee MRI, yielding an incorrect response. With\na multi-round interaction involving user correction, the model ultimately made an accurate diagnosis.\n2.10 GPT-4V suffers from hallucination issues.\nHallucination refers to the generation of responses that sound natural, but are factually incorrect, nonsensical,\nor unfaithful to the provided source input. Take the report generation task as an example (Figs. 20, 86,\n88, 93, 118 and 123), although GPT-4V can generate reports conforming to a standard structural template.\nHowever, the content within these reports is often inaccurate, even when there exits obvious abnormalities in\nthe images (Fig. 95) or certain areas already identified (Fig. 103).\n2.11 Performance variation and inconsistency.\nGPT-4V exhibits significant variations in performance when being tasked to analyze common imaging\nmodalities (Figs. 5, 6, 15, 16 and 58) compared to rare ones (Figs. 8, 10, 12, 14, 17 and 61) in terms of\ndifferent body systems. Additionally, its analysis of the same medical image can yield inconsistent results\nwith different prompts, for example, as shown in Fig. 4, GPT-4V initially predict the given image as being\nabnormal under prompt \u201cWhat is the diagnosis for this brain CT?\", however, it later generates a report that\nconsiders the same image to be normal. This inconsistency underscores the fact that GPT-4V\u2019s performance\nin clinical diagnosis can potentially be unstable and unreliable.\n2.12 Safety.\nWe found that GPT-4V has set up safeguard against potential misuse, ensuring users to understand its\ncapabilities before using. For example, When asked to make a diagnosis, for example, \"Please provide the\ndiagnosis for this chest X-ray.\" , it may refuse to offer an answer, or pose emphasis on \u201cI\u2019m not a substitute\nfor professional medical advice\", or include phrases like \u201cappears to be\" or \u201ccould be\", to express uncertainty\nas shown in Fig. 87.\n3 Qualitative Analysis of Radiology\n3.1 Central Nervous System\nThe central nervous system comprises the brain, spinal cord, their associated vascular structures, and the\nenclosing membranes, known as the meninges. The central nervous system examinations usually include cranial\nnerve examination, movement system inspection, sensory system examination, physiological/pathological\nreflex examination and autonomic nervous system examination etc. The imaging modalities in central nervous\nsystem examinations involve CT, MRI, X-ray, ultrasound, angiography, and nuclear medicine imaging. We\nhave shown seven cases in Figs. 4 to 14.\n|16 3.2 Head and Neck\nIn radiology, the \u2018head and neck\u2019 refers to all the anatomical structures in this region excluding the central\nnervous system. Many pathologies are confined to a particular area of the head and neck, thus separating this\nsection of the human body exceptionally useful. CT, MRI, X-ray, ultrasound, and angiography are often used\nto diagnose the relevant diseases. We have shown five cases in Figs. 15 to 19.\n3.3 Cardiac\nThe cardiac system, central to human physiology, benefits immensely from radiological advancements.\nRadiology is indispensable in diagnosing, monitoring, and managing cardiac conditions. Based on the data\ncollected from Radiopedia, the main imaging modalities are CT and X-rays. In addition, MRI, ultrasound,\nand other modes also exist despite their relatively small amount. Figs. 20 to 27 show examples of different\nmodalities in different cases and comparisons between different evaluation settings.\n3.4 Chest\nRadiological examinations of the chest encompass a range of imaging modalities, including PET, CT, MRI,\nX-ray, and ultrasound. These diagnostic tools yield valuable insights into the intricate anatomy and pathology\nof the lungs, heart, chest wall, mediastinum, and thoracic structures. They play a pivotal role in the detection,\ndiagnosis, monitoring, and treatment planning of various thoracic conditions. Figs. 28 to 32 demonstrate\nexamples of different modalities.\n3.5 Hematology\nRadiological reporting in hematology lies in its crucial role in the diagnosis, staging, and monitoring of\nhematological disorders. CT, MRI, X-ray, and ultrasound offer a non-invasive means to assess various aspects\nof hematological conditions. These modalities enable the visualization and characterization of lymph nodes,\nspleen, liver, bone marrow, and other relevant structures, aiding in the detection and evaluation of primary\nand metastatic hematological malignancies, as well as non-malignant hematological disorders. We have shown\nfive cases in Figs. 33 to 38.\n3.6 Hepatobiliary\nThe hepatobiliary system is critical for digestion and composed of the biliary tract and liver. The liver is\nlocated in the abdomen, as the largest organ, it plays essential roles in homeostasis, including metabolism,\nglycogen storage, drug detoxication, production of various serum proteins, and bile secretion. We have shown\nexamples in Figs. 39 to 46.\n3.7 Gastrointestinal\nThe gastrointestinal system comprises the GI tract and accessory organs. The GI tract consists of the oral\ncavity, pharynx, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, and anal canal. The accessory organs\ninclude the teeth, tongue, and glandular organs such as salivary glands, liver, gallbladder, and pancreas. The\nimaging modalities in gastrointestinal system examinations involve X-ray, CT, MRI, and Ultrasound. We\nhave shown examples in Figs. 47 to 51.\n3.8 Urogenital\nThe urogenital system, comprised of both the urinary and genital organs, holds significant importance in\nradiologicalassessments. Giventheintricaciesofitsstructureandfunction, apreciseanddetailedunderstanding\nis imperative for diagnosing pathologies affecting these regions. Radiology plays an instrumental role in\nthe visualization, diagnosis, and management of diseases related to the kidneys, ureters, bladder, urethra,\nprostate, testes, ovaries, and other associated structures. Common imaging modalities utilized for urogenital\nassessments include CT(including annotation), MRI, X-ray(including fluoroscopy), ultrasound. These tools\nnot only facilitate the identification of anomalies, but also aid in therapeutic interventions when necessary.\nExamples of different modalities and comparisons among different evaluation settings are shown by Figs. 115,\n|17 116 and 118 to 123.\n3.9 Gynecology\nThe gynecology system focuses on the female reproductive system, specifically, the uterus, ovaries, and other\nrelated organs. We have shown five cases in Figs. 52 to 56.\n3.10 Obstetrics\nObstetrics is the field of study concentrated on pregnancy, childbirth and the postpartum period. The most\ncommon imaging modality used in examination is Ultrasound. MRI, CT, and X-ray may also be used to\nscreen and diagnosis. We have shown examples in Figs. 57 to 61.\n3.11 Breast\nBreast system includes diverse radiologic exams, focusing on the breast and the main imaging modality is\nmammography, that uses low-dose X-rays to shoot the breast, screening for breast cancer. Besides, ultrasound,\nMRI, and CT may also be used to screen or diagnose. We have shown examples in Figs. 62 to 68.\n3.12 Musculoskeletal\nThe musculoskeletal system supports our body with movement ability. It can be divided into two broad\nsystems, muscular system, which covers all types of muscles in the body, and skeletal system composed of the\nbones. We have shown examples in Figs. 69 to 78.\n3.13 Spine\nThe spine system comprises the vertebrae, facet joints, intervertebral disks, spinal cord, nerves, and soft\ntissues. In this section, we present diverse exams across different modalities, including X-ray, CT, MRI, and\nNuclear medicine. We have shown examples in Figs. 79 to 86.\n3.14 Vascular\nRadiology reports provide a detailed assessment and diagnosis of the vascular system, as well as guide relevant\ntreatments and interventions. Vascular radiology reports utilize various imaging techniques such as CT, MRI,\nFluoroscopy, Nuclear Medicine and ultrasound to provide information about vascular anatomy, hemodynamics,\nand vascular pathologies. We have shown examples in Figs. 87 to 92.\n3.15 Oncology\nRadiologyplaysapivotalroleinoncology, aidinginthedetection, staging, andmonitoringofcancers. Advanced\nimaging modalities like X-ray, CT, MRI, PET, and ultrasound provide insights into tumor morphology,\nmetastatic spread, and treatment response. These diagnostic tools not only help in characterizing tumors, but\nare also instrumental in treatment planning and post-therapeutic surveillance. There are eleven cases with\nthese modalities and comparisons among different evaluation settings shown as Figs. 93 to 103.\n3.16 Trauma\nThe trauma system refers to a medical specialty that focuses on the treatment of physical injuries, typically\nsevere, which are often caused by accidents, falls, sports injuries, and violence. X-ray is the most commonly\nused imaging modality and besides, CT and MRI are somtimes used. We have shown examples in Figs. 104\nto 108.\n3.17 Pediatrics\nPediatrics is the branch of medicine dedicated to the medical care of infants, children, and adolescents,\nspanning from birth up to the age of 18 (and sometimes beyond). Since most common patients are adults, the\ncases in this system may be viewed as hard examples. CT, MRI, X-ray, and ultrasound are all commonly\n|18 used imaging techniques in this system. We have shown examples in Figs. 109 to 114.\n3.18 Localization\nLocalization of anatomical structures and anomalies is a critical procedure in medical diagnosis, which\nfacilitates the analysis, diagnosis and treatment. Depending on the clinical needs, the localization tasks could\nbe applied to a wide range of targets on different modalities. In this evaluation, we consider 12 specific\nlocalization tasks: localization of pneumothorax in Chest X-ray image (Fig. 124); localization of cardiomegaly\nin Chest X-ray image (Fig. 137); localization of mass in breast X-ray image (Fig. 138) and localization of\nfracture in palm X-ray image (Fig. 139); localization of spleen in abdomen CT image (Fig. 125); localization\nof liver and liver tumor in abdomen CT images (Figs. 126 and 127); localization of kidneys and tumors in\nabdomen CT images (Figs. 128 to 130); localization of sacrum in spine MRI images (Figs. 131 and 132);\nlocalization of cerebellum in brain MRI images (Figs. 133 and 134); localization of brain tumor in MRI\nimages (Figs. 135 and 136).\n4 Qualitative Analysis of Pathology\nPathological diagnosis is currently the golden standard for examining malignant tumors in clinical applications.\nIn this section, to investigate the capabilities of GPT-4V, on report generation and medical diagnosis for\npathology images, we perform patch-level study encompassing 20 distinct malignant tumors from different\ntissues.\n4.1 Procedure of pathology evaluation\nWe conduct a two-round conversations with GPT-4V across all test cases. At the first round, we input both a\npathology image and a formatted question \u201cMay you please write a report for this image?\". This aims to test\nwhether GPT-4V can identify image modalities and then write a structured report for this pathology image\nwith no medical prompts provided. At the second round, the tissue origin of each pathology image is fed to\nGPT-4V and a formatted question \u201cWhat is most likely diagnostic result based on the image and report?\" is\nentered. We expect to probe GPT-4V\u2019s ability on modifying the report with the new medical prompt, thus\nmake a clear diagnosis for the given pathology image.\n4.2 Pros and cons of GPT-4V on pathology image analysis\n\u2022P1. Modality identification. GPT-4v can identify the modality of all tested pathology images (H&E\nstained microscopic view of tissue sample), as shown in the first few sentences of the generated report\nin Figs. 140 to 159.\n\u2022P2. Report generation. Given a single pathology image without any medical prompts, GPT-4V\ncan generate a structured and detailed report to describe the image features, as shown in Figs. 140\nto 159. In 7 ( Figs. 140, 142, 144, 147, 149, 153 and 158) out of 20 cases, GPT-4V impressively\nitemizes its observations by terminologies, such as \u201cTissue architecture\", \u201cCellular characteristics\",\n\u201cStroma\", \u201cGlandular structures\", \u201cNuclei\", etc. Encouragingly, GPT-4V can correctly recognize\nglandular structures ( Figs. 144, 147, 154, 155, 158 and 159) and epithelium features ( Figs. 140, 141,\n153 and 156) from pathology images across different tissues.\n\u2022P3. Prompt-guided modification. At the second round conversation, GPT-4V can largely modify\nits report based on the new medical prompt of tissue origin, as shown in Figs. 155 and 157, and provide\none certain diagnosis Figs. 144, 146, 147 and 154 for predicted normal case, or several potential options\nfor predicted abnormal ones ( Figs. 140, 142, 143, 145, 148 to 150, 152, 156, 158 and 159).\n\u2022C1. Knowledge-based description Although GPT-4V can write a structured report for pathology\nimages, many detailed descriptions about cell and nuclei are general features of H&E stained images,\nnot image-specific patterns. For instance, the description of \u201cpurple-stained nuclei surrounded by a\npinkish cytoplasm\" in Fig. 141 and \u201cThe tissue section demonstrates layers of epithelial cells with nuclei\n|19 stained dark purple by the hematoxylin. The cytoplasm of the cells is stained pink by the eosin\" in\nFig. 146. Additionally, the diagnostic results provided by GPT-4V could also derive from general medical\nknowledge rather than the morphological structures of the given pathology image, as shown in Fig. 143.\n\u2022C2. Limited diagnostic performance. In summary, GPT-4V misdiagnoses four cases as normal\ntissues (Figs. 144, 146, 147 and 154), correctly diagnoses 3 tumors from the tissue of bladder( Fig. 141),\nCNS( Fig. 145) and oral cavity( Fig. 153), and leaves vague diagnoses for the rest 13 malignant tumors.\nEspecially for the tissue of anus (Fig. 140), uterus (Fig. 159), the diagnostic results of GPT-4V vary from\nnormal tissues to malignant tumors, indicating that GPT-4V may not truly detect the abnormalities\nfrom these pathology image.\n|20 Central Nervous System: Case 1\nWhat is the diagnosis for this brain CT?\nI am not a medical professional, but the provided image appears to be a non-contrast axial CT scan of the brain. \nFrom this image alone, one might note a hyperdense (whiter) area which seems to be in the region of the left basal \nganglia and surrounding structures . This could be suggestive of several conditions, including but not limited to:\n1.Acute intracerebral hemorrhage .\n2.Hyperdense artery sign (in case of an acute ischemic stroke).\n3.Other space -occupying lesions.\nIt's essential to be aware that the interpretation of radiologic images requires expertise and correlation with clinical \npresentation and other diagnostic studies. It's crucial to consult with a radiologist or neurologist for an accurate \ndiagnosis. If you or someone you know is concerned about a medical condition, please seek advice from a \nhealthcare professional .\nExtensive subarachnoid hemorrhageGPT-4V \nReference answerPrompt \nGenerate a radiology report for this head CT scan.Prompt \nI'm not a radiologist, and the following is not a substitute for a professional interpretation, but based on the \nprovided CT image of the head:\nRadiological Findings:\n1.The ventricular system appears within normal limits in size and shape.\n2.No obvious signs of midline shift or mass effect.\n3.The cortical sulci and basal cisterns appear preserved.\n4.No overt hyperdense or hypodense lesions noted.\n5.The bone structures of the skull appear intact with no visible fractures.\n6.Sinuses and mastoid air cells appear clear.\nImpression:\n1.No acute radiological findings identified on the provided single axial slice of the head CT.\nHowever, a complete assessment requires a review of the entire series of images.

This case shows a subarachnoid hemorrhage CT image of the brain. During\ndiagnosis, GPT-4V recognizes the abnormality and lists multiple choices but can\u2019t give a precise diagnosis. While generating the\nreport, GPT-4V instead thinks it\u2019s a normal image. This case shows that GPT-4V can\u2019t give an accurate diagnosis and can be\ninconsistent under different prompts. The original Radiopaedia case can be found in https://radiopaedia.org//cases/ruptured-\naca-a1-aneurysm-diagnosis-and-treatment?lang=us.\n|21 Central Nervous System: Case 2\nWhat is the diagnosis of this brain MRI?Prompt \nThe provided image is an axial view of a brain MRI . Based on the single slice provided :\nThere appears to be an area of hyperintensity or increased signal in the right frontal lobe , which could be \nsuggestive of various pathologies. These may include, but are not limited to, a glioma , metastasis , demyelinating\nlesion , infarct , or other types of lesions .\nHowever , accurate diagnosis from a single MRI slice is challenging, and MRI interpretation requires viewing \nmultiple sequences (T1, T2, FLAIR, DWI, post -contrast images, etc.) and multiple slices to make a definitive \ndiagnosis .\nMoreover , correlating the imaging findings with clinical symptoms, patient history, and other investigations is crucial. \nIt's essential to consult with a radiologist or neurologist for a comprehensive evaluation and accurate diagnosis.GPT-4V \nMeningioma.Reference answerBased on the provided MRI images, there appears to be a sizable lesion in the right frontal lobe of the brain. \nFeatures observed in the images :\n1.T1 Weighted Image (first image): The lesion is hypointense (darker) relative to surrounding brain tissue .\n2.T2 Weighted Image (second image): The lesion demonstrates hyperintensity (brighter) with surrounding \nvasogenic edema (swelling) which is also hyperintense .\n3.T1 Post -Contrast Image (third image): There is a central area without enhancement, suggestive of necrosis, \nsurrounded by ring enhancement.\n4.Diffusion Weighted Image (fourth image, if correct assumption): This type of image helps in determining the \ndiffusion characteristics of a lesion .\nThe features \u2013particularly the ring enhancement on post -contrast images, central necrosis, and surrounding \nedema \u2013are characteristic of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), which is a high -grade primary brain tumor. However, \nother possibilities include metastatic tumors, brain abscess, or other less common entities .\nIt's essential to understand that while these features are suggestive of GBM, a definitive diagnosis requires a \ncombination of imaging, clinical context, and, most critically, histopathological examination (biopsy).Please consult \na neurologist or neurosurgeon for an expert opinion and potential next steps for management.GPT-4V What is the diagnosis of these brain MRIs?Prompt \nFigure 5 |Central Nervous System: Case 2 . This case shows meningiom brain MRI images. When giving single brain MRI\nimage, GPT-4V recognizes the abnormality and lists multiple choices but can\u2019t give a concrete diagnosis. When giving multiple\nbrain MRI images, GPT-4V gives more analysis for each image and gives one concrete diagnosis. But it says the wrong MRI\nmodalities and diagnosis. This case shows that GPT-4V may concretize its conclusion with more visual prompts but not necessarily\nimprove accuracy.The original Radiopaedia case can be found in https://radiopaedia.org//cases/meningioma-114?lang=us.|22 Central Nervous System: Case 3 \nWhat is the diagnosis for these brain MRIs?Prompt \nI'm not a medical professional, but these appear to be MRI images of the brain. Based on the images provided, \nthere seem to be large mass lesions in the brain. These could be consistent with tumors , abscesses , or other \nspace -occupying lesions . The exact nature, be it benign or malignant, and other specifics cannot be determined \nwithout a proper clinical evaluation, additional imaging studies, and possibly biopsy.\nIf these are your MRI scans or belong to someone you know, it's crucial to consult with a radiologist or neurologist \nfor a proper diagnosis and any necessary follow -up.GPT-4V \nAdamantinomatous craniopharyngioma ( tumor )Reference answer\nCertainly. Based on the provided MRI images: The mass appears to be located in the brain's posterior region, \npredominantly affecting the cerebellum. The cerebellum is situated at the back of the brain, beneath the cerebral \nhemispheres, and is primarily responsible for coordinating movement. Please note that while I can provide general \nobservations based on the images, I'm not a medical professional. For an accurate interpretation and diagnosis, \nconsulting with a radiologist or neurologist is essential.GPT-4V Can you describe the location of the mass in the brain?Prompt \nThe mass is located in the sellar -suprasellar area . It projects superiorly into the third and lateral ventricles \n(left>right), causing severe obstructive hydrocephalus.Reference answer\nBased on the provided MRI images: The mass in the brain appears to have both solid and cystic components. The \nbrighter (hyperintense) regions on the T2 -weighted images (the images you've provided appear to be T2 -weighted \ngiven the cerebrospinal fluid is bright) could represent cystic or necrotic portions, while the other regions could \nrepresent more solid tumor components.\nHowever, it's essential to understand that MRI interpretation requires specialized training, and my observation is \nbased on the images provided and general knowledge. The exact nature of the lesion \u2014whether it's benign or \nmalignant, its type, and other specifics \u2014would require a detailed radiological evaluation, often in combination \nwith clinical history, physical examination, and other diagnostic tests. Always consult with a radiologist or \nneurologist for a definitive interpretation and diagnosis.GPT-4V What is the nature of the mass? Is it solid or cystic?Prompt \nThe mass is a large, well -defined, lobulated, necrotic solid mass.Reference answerFigure 6 |Central Nervous System: Case 3 . This case shows several adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma brain MRI\nimages. During diagnosis, GPT-4V tells the sizeable lesion and gives multiple possible conclusions. It fails to localize the lesion\nbut precisely tells the lesion is both solid and cystic based on its signal on T2-weighted image. The case shows GPT-4V have\nbasic medical knowledge.The original Radiopaedia case can be found in https://radiopaedia.org//cases/adamantinomatous-\ncraniopharyngioma-44?lang=us.\n|23 Central Nervous System: Case 3 cont. \nGenerate a radiology report for these abnormal brain MRIs.Prompt \nBrain MRI -Axial and Sagittal Views\nClinical Indication: Not provided.\nTechnique: Multiple sequences of axial and sagittal images of the brain.\nFindings:\n1.Brain Parenchyma: The brain parenchyma appears largely intact. No evidence of significant mass effect or \nmidline shift observed .\n2.Lesions: There is a hyperintense lesion in the central region, possibly the region of the ventricles. The exact \nnature of the lesion is not clear from the images provided. Further sequences or contrast enhancement might \nbe required for better characterization.\n3.Ventricles: The ventricular system appears to be slightly enlarged, suggestive of some degree of \nhydrocephalus. The exact cause and type of hydrocephalus would need to be determined.\n4.Cerebellum and Brainstem: No significant abnormalities are readily apparent in the cerebellum or brainstem.\n5.Sinuses: Paranasal sinuses are not fully visualized in these cuts.\nImpression:\n1.Hyperintense lesion in the central region of the brain, further characterization required .\n2.Possible hydrocephalus with enlarged ventricular system .\nRecommendation: Correlation with clinical symptoms and further imaging, possibly with contrast, is \nrecommended for a definitive diagnosis. A consultation with a neuroradiologist or neurosurgeon is advised for \nexpert opinion.Please note, this is a general observation and not a definitive diagnosis.

Subependymal edema and peripheral effacement of cerebral sulcations is demonstrated .Reference answerFigure 7 |Central Nervous System: Case 3 . In the generated report, GPT-4V successfully recognizes the hydrocephalus\nand the hyperintense lesion. It proves GPT-4V have basic medical knowledge to do recognize some diseases and lesion intensities\nin MRI.The original Radiopaedia case can be found in https://radiopaedia.org//cases/adamantinomatous-craniopharyngioma-\n44?lang=us.\n|24 Central Nervous System: Case 4 \nWhat is the diagnosis for this brain ultrasound?Prompt \nI'm not a medical professional, but the image appears to be an ultrasound, possibly of a brain structure. It's \nimportant to consult with a radiologist or a medical specialist to get an accurate diagnosis and interpretation of any \nmedical images. They can provide comprehensive insights based on their expertise and training.GPT-4V \nGrade IV germinal matrix hemorrhage with periventricular leukomalaciaThere is bilateral germinal matrix \nhemorrhage that extends into the parenchyma and dilated ventricles (grade IV). Right anterior horn ventricle \ncraniocaudal dimension; 10 mm on the right and 10 mm on the left.Grey -white matter differentiation is preserved. \nCortical folding is appropriate for age.Normal echogenicity and homogeneity of subcortical white matter. Thalami \nand basal ganglia are normal. The width of the subarachnoid spaces are appropriate for age. No midline shift.Reference answer\nWhat is the grade of bilateral germinal matrix hemorrhage in the patient?Prompt \nI'm not a doctor, but the image appears to show an ultrasound of the brain, and you seem to be referring to \ngerminal matrix hemorrhage (GMH), which is a type of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) commonly seen in \npremature infants.There are several grading systems for GMH/IVH. The most commonly used system classifies \nthe hemorrhages into four grades:\n-Grade I: Hemorrhage is limited to the germinal matrix.\n-Grade II: Hemorrhage extends into the lateral ventricles but does not cause ventricular dilation.\n-Grade III: Hemorrhage fills and enlarges the ventricles.\n-Grade IV: Hemorrhage extends into the brain tissue surrounding the ventricles .\nBased on the provided image, it's challenging to definitively determine the grade of the GMH/IVH. Accurate\ndiagnosis and grading would require a comprehensive evaluation of the images by a trained radiologist or\nneonatologist. If this is a medical concern, it's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate\ndiagnosis.\"GPT-4V \nGrade IV.Reference answerFigure 8 |Central Nervous System: Case 4 . This case shows a Grade IV germinal matrix hemorrhage ultrasound brain\nimage. GPT-4V fails to give the diagnosis and the specific grade of the germinal matrix hemorrhage.

A few general observations can be made from bone scans:\n1.Hot Spots(areas of increased uptake): These could suggest \nareas of increased bone turnover, which could be due to \nfractures, tumors, infections, arthritis, etc.\n2.Cold Spots(areas of decreased uptake): These could suggest \nareas with decreased blood flow or bone turnover, such as \ncertain types of tumors or avascular necrosis.\nHowever, I cannot make a definitive diagnosis based on this image \nalone. It's important to consult with a nuclear medicine physician or \nradiologist for an accurate interpretation and diagnosis.\nA bone scan, such as the one provided in the image, is a nuclear medicine imaging test that uses a small \namount of radioactive material to help diagnose and evaluate various bone diseases and conditions. The \npurpose of a bone scan can be varied, depending on the clinical context. Here are the primary reasons a bone \nscan might be ordered:\n1.Detecting Bone Metastases :Bone scans are frequently used to detect metastatic cancer. Certain cancers, \nsuch as prostate and breast cancer, often metastasize to bones.\n2.Identifying Bone Infections :The scan can help identify osteomyelitis, an infection of the bone.\n3.Evaluating Unexplained Bone Pain : If a patient is experiencing localized bone pain without a known cause, \na bone scan can help in identifying potential reasons.\n4.Assessing Bone Fractures : Some fractures, especially those that are stress or hairline fractures, might not \nbe immediately evident on conventional X -rays. A bone scan can help detect such fractures.\n5.Monitoring Conditions : Conditions such as Paget's disease of the bone or other bone disorders can be \nmonitored using bone scans.\n6.Evaluating Joint Disorders : The scan can be used to diagnose certain conditions affecting joints, such as \nosteoarthritis.\nTo detect skeletal metastasis .What is the diagnosis of this nuclear medicine imaging?Prompt \nWhat is the purpose of the bone scan?Prompt \nReference answerGPT-4V \nGPT-4V Figure 12 |Central Nervous System: Case 6 .

However, accurately determining cardiomegaly (enlargement of \nthe heart) often requires measurements and comparisons to standard values. Typically, the width of the heart \nshould be less than half the width of the chest on a PA chest X-ray to be considered within normal limits.GPT-4V Figure 33 |Hematology: Case 1: This is an X-ray of a patient with acute pulmonary graft versus host disease and typhlitis.\nWhen we asked GPT-4V to generate a report, it was able to recognize the presence of inserted external devices and the presence\nof some opacification bilaterally. However, it did not identify any abnormalities in the heart. Additionally, the \u2019L\u2019 marking on the\nright side of the image indicates the actual left side of the body, but GPT-4V did not understand this correctly and provide a\nwrong position of the external device.

The lesion's boundaries are not well defined in \nthis view.\n- Bilateral maxillary and ethmoid sinuses appear clear.\n- Nasal cavity appears unremarkable.\nSagittal CT Image 3 (Bottom Image)\n- The cervical spine alignment appears maintained.\n- The pharyngeal airway is clear.\n- The oral cavity, oropharynx, and hypopharynx appear unremarkable.\n- No evidence of bony erosion or invasion.\nImpression:Radiolucent lesion in the left parotid region. This may be consistent with a benign cystic lesion, such as a simple \ncyst or benign salivary gland tumor, given the patient's age and the painless nature of the swelling. However, \nfurther characterization with MRI and possible biopsy may be necessary for definitive diagnosis.There is a well-defined homogeneously relatively hyper enhancing lesion measuring 3 x 2.5 cm seen in the left \nsubmandibular area, without internal calcification, fat or necrosis, causing mass-effect on the left submandibular \ngland, left sternocleidomastoid muscle and mild mass-effect on the left internal jugular vein.\nNo other masses or enlarged cervical lymph nodes.Reference answerPrompt \nGPT-4V \nWhat structures are affected by the mass-effect caused by the lesion?Prompt \nBased on the provided CT images and the description \uff0cMass-Effect from the Lesion:\n- Left Parotid Gland: The lesion primarily seems to originate from the left parotid gland region, which is part of the \nmajor salivary glands.\n- Adjacent Soft Tissue Structures: The lesion may be exerting mass effect on adjacent soft tissue structures, \npotentially displacing them or causing some compression.\n- Surrounding Musculature: Given the location, muscles surrounding the parotid gland such as the \nsternocleidomastoid and posterior belly of the digastric might be affected or displaced.GPT-4V Figure 38 |Hematology: Case 5: This is a case of Castleman disease: unicentric - mandible.

From my understanding:\nThe first image looks like a sagittal view of the knee. The arrow seems to be pointing towards the posterior horn of \nthe meniscus . The second image appears to be an axial or coronal view of the knee , and the arrow is pointing to \nan area that looks like the meniscus. The third image looks like another sagittal view of the knee with the arrow \npointing towards the meniscus or possible the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) region. The last image again seems \nlike a sagittal view of the knee. The arrow is pointing towards the meniscus, possibly the posterior horn.\nFrom the images, there might be some irregularities or changes in the signal intensity of the menisci, particularly \nwhere the arrows are pointing. These could suggest a possible meniscal tear or degeneration, but it's essential to \nunderstand that accurate diagnosis requires a comprehensive review of the full set of MRI images, clinical history, \nand physical examination by a radiologist or orthopedic surgeon. If these images are of concern, you should \nconsult with a medical professional.Prompt \nGPT-4V \nTwo lesions of intermediate to low signal intensity are detected on T2WI, implicating the anterior wall of the upper \nthird rectum with the classic \"Mushroom cap sign of endometriosis\". Another endometriotic lesion is observed on \nthe left posterolateral wall of the upper third vagina. There is no diffusion restriction visible on the lesions, but they \ndo show post -contrast enhancement.\nThe uterus is bulky and shows multiple variable -sized fibroids the largest located on the anterior wall. The \njunctional zone is relatively thickened with hyperintense myometrial foci suggesting adenomyosis.\nThe arrows show Mushroom cap sign of endometriosis.Reference answer\nPrompt \nThese are the MRI images of the Pelvic.\nGPT-4V \nI apologize for the oversight. Given that these are pelvic MRIs:\nThe first image appears to be a sagittal view of the pelvis. The arrow seems to be pointing towards the uterus, \npossibly the endometrial cavity or myometrium.\nThe second image appears to be an axial view of the pelvis. The arrow is pointing towards an area that looks like \nthe uterus or an adjoining structure.\nThe third image seems to be another sagittal view of the pelvis with the arrow potentially pointing towards the \nposterior aspect of the uterus or cervix.\nThe fourth image is another sagittal view, with the arrow pointing towards what appears to be the uterus, perhaps \nthe endometrial cavity.\nFrom the images, there might be some irregularities or changes in the signal intensity, possibly suggesting \nconditions like endometrial thickening, fibroids, or adenomyosis .

The common use of such ultrasounds is to\nmonitor the development of a fetus during pregnancy, though it can also be used to visualize organs, blood\nvessels, and other internal structures .\n2.Anatomy Visible: The image prominently displays what seems to be a cross -sectional view of a fetus. There\nare dark circular areas that could represent the cranial cavities, and other structures potentially representing\ndeveloping organs or limbs . The exact gestational age or specific anatomy is not entirely clear from this single\nsnapshot .\n3.Quality and Clarity: The image quality appears to be adequate for diagnostic purposes. However, a full\ninterpretation would typically require multiple images from different angles and planes to provide a\ncomprehensive view .\n4.Labeling : There's a label \"LOGIQ F\" in the image, which might indicate the model or brand of the ultrasound\nmachine used. The exact significance of this label would depend on the context in which it was used .\n5.Other Observations: Without additional context, specifics about the gestational age, potential abnormalities, or\nother findings cannot be definitively concluded from this single image .\nIt's crucial to consult with a medical professional, preferably a radiologist or obstetrician, for a detailed and \naccurate interpretation of ultrasound images. They can provide insights tailored to individual cases and \ncircumstances.GPT-4V \nhow many babies are there in the image?Prompt \nThe image appears to be an ultrasound, and it looks like there are three distinct fetal profiles. So, it seems there \nare three babies in the image. However, it's essential to consult with a medical professional for an accurate \ninterpretation.GPT-4V \nThree gestational sacs were visualized in utero, each with a separate fetal pole, yolk sac and cardiac activity. \nGestational age using the crown -rump length method corresponded to 6 weeks.Reference answer\nFigure 58 |Obstetrics: Case 2 .

There is no evidence of dislocation or arthritic changes .\n3.Femurs:Both proximal femurs (the upper part closer to the hip) are visible and display no evident fractures or\nabnormalities.\n4.Soft Tissues: The surrounding soft tissues do not show any conspicuous masses or calcifications .\n5.Lower Spine:A portion of the lower spine (sacrum and coccyx) can be observed at the top of the image. The\nvisible sections seem normal without any noticeable signs of fractures or misalignment .\nIn summary, the radiograph displays a pelvic region with no obvious pathologic findings . It is important to note that \nwhile X -ray images can be useful in identifying bone abnormalities or fractures, they do not provide detailed \ninformation about soft tissue injuries or diseases. Clinical correlation and consultation with a radiologist or \northopedic specialist are advised for a comprehensive assessment.GPT-4V \nWhat is wrong with the pubic?Prompt \nThe image you've provided is an X-ray of the pelvic region . I'm not a radiologist, but it appears there might be \nsome irregularities or asymmetry in the pubic region , potentially suggesting a fracture or some other pathology .\nHowever , interpreting medical images requires expertise and a full clinical context.

The exact origin and nature of this structure would require further clinical correlation.\nLungs: There are areas of increased opacity, potentially indicating regions of consolidation or masses.\nOther Observations: there appears to be an area of increased density along the right lateral thoracic wall, \nsuggestive of a possible pleural effusion.\nSecond Image ( Coronal Slice ):\nThorax: There is a clear presence of a structure or mass in the left thoracic region, anteriorly adjacent to the heart. This could potentially involve the lung or mediastinal structures.\nUpper Abdomen: It seems that there is some form of heterogeneity or potential pathology in the liver. This may \nrepresent a lesion or area of altered attenuation.Other Observations: a similar area of increased density is visible along the right lateral thoracic cavity.

Here's a broad overview based on the images:\nFrom the image you provided and the above images:\nPresence of Mass: The mass or structure in the mediastinal region or left lung seems to be consistent across \nboth the initial and the recent images. If there is a change in size, it's not immediately evident from the images \nprovided.\nLung Opacities: The areas of increased opacity in the lung fields, potentially indicating regions of consolidation \nor masses, appear to be present in both the initial and subsequent images. A direct comparison regarding their \nprogression or regression is challenging without calibrated measurements.\nLiver Heterogeneity: The heterogeneity or potential pathology in the liver was not evident in the initial image but \nappears in the later images. This suggests a possible new finding or progression, though the initial image might \nnot have captured the same anatomical location as the later images.\nOther Structures: Structures like the spine, vascular structures, and other organs do not show obvious changes \nbetween the two sets of images, at least from a general observational standpoint.\nIn summary, there seem to be consistent findings between the two sets of images, with a potential new or more \npronounced finding in the liver in the later images. However, without calibrated measurements, specific \nsequences, and clinical context, it's challenging to definitively say if the patient's condition has worsened or \nimproved.\nFollow-up PET-CT done 3.5 months later, after several doses of chemotherapy, shows significant regression of \nthe primary mass and outstanding regression of the mediastinal- bihilar  lymphadenopathy.

Microscopic Image Report\nImage Description :\nThe image displays a microscopic view of tissue sections , \nstained to reveal cellular and structural details.\nObservations :\n1. Adipose Tissue : There are multiple clear, round \nstructures which represent adipose tissue or fat cells. These \ncells are identifiable by their large, clear, vacuolated \nappearance. The nuclei of these cells are pushed to the \nperiphery due to the large fat droplet they contain.\n2. Other Cells : Interspersed between the fat cells, there \nappear to be smaller cells with dense nuclei, possibly \nrepresenting fibroblasts or other stromal cells.\nThis is an image of bone marrow. What is most likely diagnostic result based on the image and report?\nPlasma cell myeloma (multiple myeloma). Amyloid deposition associated a vessel in the bone marrow clot section of a \npatient with plasma cell myeloma stained with Congo redBased on the image and the report, the prominent feature observed is adipose tissue within the bone marrow. \nBone marrow contains both hematopoietic (blood -forming) tissue and stromal (supportive) tissue which includes \nfat cells.\nIn a typical adult bone marrow sample, the presence of adipose tissue is normal. However, the ratio of \nhematopoietic tissue to adipose tissue can vary depending on the age of the individual and the location from \nwhich the bone marrow sample was taken.\nThe increased prominence of adipose tissue at the expense of hematopoietic tissue can be suggestive of a few \nscenarios:\n1. Age and Site -related Changes : It's normal for certain bones, especially those of the extremities in older \nadults, to have more fatty marrow.\n2. Bone Marrow Hypoplasia : An abnormally low amount of hematopoietic tissue relative to fat might indicate \nmarrow hypoplasia, a condition where the bone marrow doesn't produce enough blood cells.\n3. Recovery Phase : After a condition or treatment that suppresses bone marrow function (like chemotherapy), \nthe marrow might show an increased amount of fat as it begins to recover.\n4. Other Conditions : Certain conditions like aplastic anemia, some types of leukemia, or after administration \nof certain medication s can also lead to changes in the bone marrow's composition.\n3. Staining : The tissue appears to be stained with a standard Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stain , judging \nfrom the blue -stained nuclei and the pinkish hue of the cytoplasm and extracellular matrix.\n4. Additional Structures : In the lower -left corner, there is a portion of tissue that is more densely cellular and \nmight represent another type of tissue, perhaps muscle or connective tissue, though further examination would \nbe needed for a definitive conclusion.\nPreliminary Interpretation :\nThe predominant feature in this image is adipose tissue, surrounded by some stromal elements.

What is most likely diagnostic result based on the image and report?\nProstate gland ductal adenocarcinoma: Prostatic ductal adenocarcinoma composed of tall pseudostratified \ncolumnar cells with simple glandular, cribriform and papillary patterns.The image you provided is of a microscopic view, and while I gave a general analysis in the previous response, \nit's essential to note that definitive diagnoses, especially in histopathology, require specialized training and often \nmultiple levels of confirmation.\nGiven that you've mentioned this is prostate tissue, the presence of glandular structures aligns with that context. \nIn the prostate, normal glandular structures can vary in appearance. Some features that pathologists look for \nwhen diagnosing prostate -related diseases include:\n1. Changes in glandular architecture\n2. Nuclear atypia (abnormal nucleus appearance)\n3. Presence of any perineural invasion\n4. Mitotic figures (indicating cell division)\n5. The pattern of stromal and epithelial interactions\nFrom the image provided, there are areas with a higher cellular density, suggesting potential regions of interest. \nHowever, without a more detailed view and examination of other areas of the tissue, it's difficult to ascertain \nwhether there are any signs of benign conditions like benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or more concerning \nfeatures suggestive of prostatic adenocarcinoma or other malignancies.\nReference answerGPT-4V Prompt \nPrompt \nGPT-4V \nPreliminary Interpretation :\nThe tissue seems to be of epithelial origin, possibly from a glandular organ such as the breast, pancreas, or \nsalivary gland . There appear to be both normal and potentially altered structures within the sample. However, a \nmore detailed analysis by a trained pathologist would be necessary to provide a definitive diagnosis or \ninterpretation.Figure 155 |Prostate.

GPT-4V correctly identifies the glandular structures from the image, while it does not provide a reasonable diagnosis.\nThe original image can be found in https://www.pathologyoutlines.com/topic/prostateprostaticduct.html.\n|172 Skin\nMay you please write a report for this image? Microscopic Image Report\nDescription :\nThe provided image depicts a histological section stained \nwith what appears to be Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E), the \nmost widely used stain in medical diagnosis.\nObservations :\n1. The section displays a layered structure, suggestive of \nepithelial tissue.\n2. The outermost layer appears thinner with elongated \nnuclei, likely representing the epidermis or a similar epithelial \nlayer.\n3. The underlying layer is denser with cells showing a \ndarker stain, indicating the presence of cell nuclei. This could \nrepresent the dermis or a similar connective tissue layer if \nthis is a skin sample.\nThis is an image of skin tissue. What is most likely diagnostic result based on the image and report?\nInvasive cutaneous melanoma : dermal nodular proliferation of dysplastic melanocytes; epidermal invasion; \nprominent pigmentation.Based on the image and the provided report:\nThe image shows a histological section of skin tissue stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E). Given the \nlayered structure, with an outermost layer representing the epidermis and a dense underlying layer likely \nrepresenting the dermis, as well as the presence of glandular or follicular structures, this aligns well with typical \nskin histology.\nHowever, the noticeable cellular proliferation in certain areas of the tissue is of concern. Such changes can be \nseen in a variety of conditions, from benign processes like skin inflammation or hyperplasia to more concerning \nconditions such as precancerous lesions or skin cancers.\nA possible diagnostic consideration could be:\n1. Benign skin conditions like hyperplasia, dermatitis, or other inflammatory skin disorders .\n2. Precancerous lesions such as actinic keratosis or dysplastic nevi.\n3. Skin malignancies , including basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma , or melanoma , depending on \nthe specific cellular features.\nReference answerGPT-4V Prompt \nPrompt \nGPT-4V \n4. There are regions in the section with glandular or follicular structures, implying the presence of sebaceous \nor sweat glands if it's a skin tissue .\n5. The overall cellular architecture looks organized, but there is a noticeable cellular proliferation in certain \nareas.\nInterpretation :\nWithout clinical context and higher magnification images, it's challenging to make a definitive diagnosis. The \ntissue section appears to be of epithelial origin, possibly skin . The observed cellular changes may be benign or \nindicative of a pathological process, so correlation with clinical findings is essential.Figure 156 |Skin.This histopathological image shows a patch of WSI for invasive cutaneous melanoma from skin tissue.\nGPT-4V correctly identifies the tissue origin from the image and provides three potential diagnoses involving the right answer.\nThe original image can be found in https://www.pathologyoutlines.com/topic/skintumormelanocyticmelanoma.html.\n|173 Stomach\nMay you please write a report for this image? Certainly! The image provided appears to be a histological \nslide stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) , a common \nstaining technique used in histology to visualize cellular and \ntissue structures.\nHere's a brief description based on the image:\nHistological Report\nSpecimen Description : The image displays a tissue section \nstained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E).\nFindings :\n1. The tissue appears to have a dense cellular composition \nwith both nucleated and non -nucleated cells.\n2. The nuclei, stained purple with hematoxylin, vary in size \nand shape, suggesting a mixture of cell types. Some nuclei \nappear to be larger and darker, which could indicate \nhyperchromatic nuclei.\n3. The pink eosinophilic regions represent the cytoplasm of \ncells or possible extracellular matrix components.\n4. Certain areas show eosinophilic streaks, possibly \nindicating collagen fibers or other extracellular matrix \nelements.\nThis is an image of stomach tissue. What is most likely diagnostic result based on the image and report?\nSporadic diffuse gastric carcinoma arising in background of chronic gastritis. Scattered signet ring cells are \npresent amidst the inflammation.Given the new information that this is stomach tissue, here's a more specific interpretation:\nHistological Report of Stomach Tissue\nSpecimen Description : The image displays a section of stomach tissue stained with hematoxylin and eosin \n(H&E).\nFindings :\n1. The tissue appears to have a dense cellular composition suggestive of glandular structures, which are \ntypical of gastric mucosa.\n2. The nuclei vary in size and shape, with some appearing larger and darker. Hyperchromatic nuclei can \nsometimes be indicative of cellular atypia or dysplasia.\n3. The pink eosinophilic regions represent the cytoplasm of cells. The presence of eosinophilic streaks could \nbe indicative of muscularis mucosae or collagen deposits.\nPreliminary Diagnosis : The cellular density and appearance of atypical nuclei raise concerns for possible \ngastric dysplasia or early neoplastic changes . However, the exact nature of these changes, whether benign, pre -\nmalignant, or malignant, cannot be definitively determined from the image alone.\nReference answerGPT-4V Prompt \nPrompt \nGPT-4V \nFigure 157 |Stomach.

Microscopic Analysis Report:\nImage Description :\nThe image depicts a microscopic view of a tissue sample, \nwhich appears to be stained, likely using a hematoxylin and \neosin (H&E) stain , a commonly used stain in histopathology.\nObservations :\n1. Tissue Architecture : The sample shows glandular \nstructures, suggestive of epithelial tissue. The arrangement \nand morphology of the cells suggest a possible section of a \nglandular organ .\n2. Cellularity : Cells appear closely packed with varying \nsizes. The nuclei of the cells are prominently stained, \nindicating the use of the hematoxylin stain.\n3. Staining Pattern : The eosinophilic regions (pinkish -red) \nsuggest the presence of cytoplasm and extracellular \ncomponents, while the basophilic regions (darker purple)\nThis is an image of thyroid tissue. What is most likely diagnostic result based on the image and report?\nPapillary thyroid carcinoma : Classic variant has typical nuclear features of papillary thyroid carcinoma, e.g., \nnuclear enlargement, overlapping, marked nuclear membrane irregularity, nuclear groove (red arrow), nuclear \npseudoinclusion (black arrow) and chromatin margination (blue arrow). Possible Diagnostic Considerations :\n1. Nodular Hyperplasia or Thyroid Adenoma : Given the appearance of closely packed follicles and varying \ncell sizes, one possibility is nodular hyperplasia or a benign thyroid adenoma. These are noncancerous \nenlargements of the thyroid.\n2. Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma : This is the most common type of thyroid cancer. One hallmark is the \npresence of cells with large, clear \"Orphan Annie\" nuclei, although it's challenging to definitively diagnose this \nbased solely on one image.\n3. Follicular Thyroid Neoplasm : It can be benign (follicular adenoma) or malignant (follicular carcinoma). A \ndefinitive diagnosis between these two often requires evaluation of capsular or vascular invasion, which may not \nbe evident in the provided image.\nReference answerGPT-4V Prompt \nPrompt \nGPT-4V indicate nuclear material.\n4. Marked Areas : Black Arrow: This points to a cell with a prominent nucleus . The significance of this marking \ndepends on the context of the study or observation. Red Arrow: Indicates a structure or feature within the cell or \ntissue , but without additional context, the specific significance remains unclear. Blue Arrow: Like the red arrow, it \npoints to a specific structure or cell . Further information would be needed to deduce its exact significance.\nPreliminary Interpretation :\nBased on the provided image, the tissue appears to be of epithelial origin with glandular features. The marked \nareas suggest areas of interest or importance, but without additional context, it's challenging to determine the \nspecific pathology or significance of these markings.\nFigure 158 |Thyroid.

Microscopic Image Report\nImage Description :\nThe image presents a microscopic view of a tissue sample , \nshowing cellular structures with varying degrees of staining.\nStaining :\nThe tissue appears to have been stained with hematoxylin \nand eosin (H&E) . Hematoxylin stains the cell nuclei blue, \nwhile eosin stains the cytoplasm and extracellular matrix pink.\nMorphological Observations :\n1. There are numerous glandular structures with luminal \nspaces present. The epithelial cells lining the glands appear \ncolumnar in shape, with basally located nuclei.\n2. The nuclei of the cells are predominantly oval to round, \nwith some variation in size and staining intensity.\n3. The stroma surrounding the glandular structures appears\nThis is an image of uterus tissue. What is most likely diagnostic result based on the image and report?\nEndometrial clear cell carcinoma . Admixed papillary and glandular architecture with clear cells and oxyphilic \ncells. Some lymphoplasmacytic inflammation is present in the stroma.Given the information provided and the image of the uterus tissue, the tissue displays features consistent with \nendometrial tissue. The glandular structures and the appearance of the epithelial cells suggest this could be from \nthe endometrial lining of the uterus. While a definitive diagnosis would require a comprehensive assessment by a \ntrained pathologist, some potential considerations based on the image might include:\n1. Normal proliferative phase endometrium : During the menstrual cycle's proliferative phase, the \nendometrial glands appear tubular with a regular shape, and the stroma is cellular.\n2. Endometrial hyperplasia : This condition is characterized by an increased proliferation of the endometrial \nglands relative to the stroma. It can be a precursor to endometrial carcinoma, but not all hyperplasias progress to \nmalignancy. Types of endometrial hyperplasia can include simple or complex hyperplasia and can be with or \nwithout atypia (atypical cellular features).\n3. Endometrial carcinoma : This is a type of cancer that arises from the endometrium. It often presents with \nglandular structures that can vary in shape and size, with cells showing increased nuclear size, irregular nuclear \ncontours, and increased mitotic activity.densely cellular .\n4. Some regions show closely packed glands, while others exhibit more stromal space.\nPreliminary Assessment:\nThe tissue appears to be of epithelial origin, possibly from a glandular tissue like that of the digestive or \nreproductive system . The exact type of tissue and any potential pathological findings would require further \nexamination and context about the source and clinical history.\nReference answerGPT-4V Prompt \nPrompt \nGPT-4V \nFigure 159 |Uterus.
